00:00:06.299,Mya,"My email the script that I sent you is really just sort of a general overview of the types of things that i'd like to talk to you about, but if you could start just with a general introduction to who you are, as you feel comfortable and generally what your adoption story is and.How if and how I guess you feel it's changed either how you've been told it, how you tell it to other people over the years.",
00:00:44.040,Participant 002,"I was born in Jiangsu at some point, probably. I was adopted when I was under a year old in the late 90s like a lot of other Chinese adoptees. My parents are both white. I have two siblings, one older one younger, who are also adopted from China. I grew up knowing I was adopted um I mean obviously the racial differences, but even then like as a kid you don't really notice your race until you really get to school and people comment about it. But I always knew I was adopted, I have no idea... I have no memory of being told, it was just kind of a fact; I also knew my my siblings were both adopted. It was just kind of a fact of life. My parents enroll us in... I guess I would call it 'culture camp,' I have no idea what the it was actually called, when I was younger and so that was Mandarin lessons like Chinese arts and crafts--paper cutting... we made paper at one point--watching movies, some of which were Asian themed others were just as the kids thing. I don't know when I stopped it, but I just remember thinking, because my parents, I believe asked me [if I wanted to stop], but it was a thing I did on Saturdays I don't really care either way. My parents did put me in Chinese dance, and I did that for a couple years when I was younger until my dance teacher retired and I decided not to I don't want to go to someone else. My mom actually worked at an adoption agency; and I think by the time she worked there, I think it's the color blind approach had been debunked the most part, I mean I know other adoptees who are adopted around the same time, who apparently it was not debunked for those parents, but for my parents my mom was always pretty clear about you know making sure we knew we were adopted, trying to engage us in Chinese culture, despite it us not wanting to. We had adoption group reunions, and so I know... not with my older sibling's group, I never understood why, I'm not sure if she had a like an actual group or not, but definitely with my group and with my younger sibling's group, we did that when we younger [although eventually] it just kinda stopped. But yeah I don't know if I have told my adoption story to a lot of people, it's not part of my introduction, it doesn't come up with strangers. And I tend to also just keep a pretty straightforward, I don't really go into details with people unless I'm good friends with them. So I don't necessarily think it's really changed all that much. Me feelings towards my adoption have shifted but that's because I was never really involved in like--I did do the adoptee reunions sort of thing, but those were pretty like one off events--so I was never really involved [in the adoption community], but when the pandemic started and I got board, I started joining adoptee Facebook groups like SAAT and stuff, so that's when I started, you know, like knowing more adoptees than just my adopting group and the ones that I somehow randomly found encountered by accident. Which kind of opened [some doors to new perspectives]--because I've never had like a really negative view of my adoption and I still don't really do, like I know there are a lot of opinions there, and some of which I agree with, some of which I disagree with--but on the whole, for me, my adoption is still a very positive experience.", adoption-story;adoption-industry;other-adoptees;birth-culture;adoption-perspective
00:04:54.990,Mya,For the like the the culture classes that you and your siblings participated in; were those specifically for adoptees or were they just generally for diasporic Chinese?,
00:04:54.990,Participant 002,"I have no idea. I know there were other adoptees. And I remember for my Chinese dance class I think a lot of us were adopted, I don't know if it was specific to adoptees though.", other-adoptees;birth-culture
00:05:17.160,Mya,"Did you. I guess, both in like how your mom sort of explained it to you, but also just I guess in your participating in it... I know you mentioned that you weren't necessarily like super gung Ho on participating all the time, was that something that you saw as as your culture per se, or was it just sort of an auxiliary thing. ",
00:05:42.840,Participant 002,"I mean, I knew I was Chinese. And yeah, I knew this was part of you know my birth culture. But I don't think I really had strong feelings. Like I thought, like 'Oh, this is cool' or 'Oh, are these dresses I really pretty' sort of thing, but I don't think there was any you know heartfelt connection to it.", birth-culture;connection
00:06:18.000,Mya,"Is that something that's changed over time, or have you developed an interest since in sort of reclaiming or participating or learning more about Chinese culture.",
00:06:32.400,Participant 002,"A little. Mostly through exposure to pop culture, so my friends got into K pop and then, of course, that got me into C pop. And I it was just all East Asian stuff for a while, but there's definitely a deeper interest because I am an adoptee but at the same time, it's not like... I see some adoptees are really *connected* and like really want to reclaim their culture, but I don't think that's it for me. Like I do it on a kind of surface level, and only if i'm interested in it.",birth-culture;asian-diaspora;other-adoptees;connection;ambivalence
00:07:08.070,Mya,yeah are there aspects of your adoptive parents' culture that you that you identify with more?,
00:07:21.780,Participant 002,"I mean, I say I'm Canadian I would never say--both my parents have family or like families were from from Great Britain and I would never say I'm Northern Irish or anything but I do say I'm Canadian and I do, like I refer to my parents' relatives as my own and not just the immediate family, who i've met... I do refer--well, depending on how close they are I guess, like I would describe someone as my dad's cousin cousin or or my dad's cousin's daughter--but I say my grandparents are my grandparents and I do call them my relatives. I mean we have family traditions, but I want to stay there necessarily ethnic based.", adopted-culture;family-ties;connection;identity
00:08:10.080,Mya,"mm hmm that makes sense, did you and your siblings grow up with a lot of like books or media or other things, in addition to the the meetings that you would have with your adoption groups that were related to adoption?",
00:08:30.840,Participant 002,"We had books definitely like children's books and I know my mom at some point, not that often, but she would come to our class and like read one of those children's books about adoption. You know, like 'there are different types of dogs'--I can't remember the actual name of that book, but it's one that we read a lot. She owuld come and explain to the class. I think she did at least twice, but I don't remember how many times it's kind of a blur... The adoption group reunions were like every two years,just an aside, they weren't actually that frequent. We'd sometimes go to... I lived in the same city of where my adoption agency was and sometimes they'd put on adoptee events. Not that often, but they would. And then for like Chinese New Year we would have Chinese food. My dad makes a very good stir fry. We did have some things, but it wasn't like we are completely immersed in it, but I also don't necessarily think we should have been like completely immersed cuz I don't think my parents were know what they're doing and I wouldn't have liked that", adoption-media;adoption-conversations;birth-culture;connection
00:09:51.000,Mya,"yeah I mean do you do you think that your parents took on or have taken on like a sort of kinship with Chinese culture in a way, because of their adoption of you and your siblings?",
00:10:11.580,Participant 002,"A little, maybe, but it is very much only because--my impression is that it was very much only because we were adopted from China.",birth-culture
00:10:19.980,Mya,"When your mom would come into your classes to do those presentations was that ever something that you had to participate in as well, or that you were encouraged to sort of.take part of the explaining bit or anything like that.",
00:10:36.090,Participant 002,"i'm going to be honest, I don't remember. I don't think so. But I also am not sure.",
00:10:42.420,Mya,You mentioned one of your siblings is younger right.,
00:10:42.420,Participant 002,yeah middle child.,
00:10:42.420,Mya,Did you actively understand like what was going on what was happening when that something was adopted or did you travel with your parents to?,
00:11:10.980,Participant 002,"I know I didn't travel and she was adopted when I was three so I don't really remember it. I think I have vague memories of it but I'm not sure if I made them up in my head, you know how child memories are. I do remember, thinking of it, like remembering going to the airport, but I'm not sure how much of that is a trick of my mind versus an actual memory. But I knew, I mean like I knew all my siblings are adopted and my younger sister is actually from the same orphanage as me.",other-adoptees;family-ties;logistics
00:11:38.970,Mya,Oh really wow okay.,
00:11:50.250,Participant 002,"Yeah I forgot to mentione, but I have been back to China twice on specifically on homeland trips and they were both when I was--there was one when I was seven and one when I was nine, so I don't actually remember them that well either, but I have gone back and visited the orphanage and Chinese landmarks.",birth-culture;returning
00:12:08.070,Mya,Was the impetus of those trips like you're your own or was that at the encouragement of your parents or...?,
00:12:08.070,Participant 002,"Oh, my parents planned it. Cuz I mean i'm certain they were told 'you should bring your child back to China at some point'? And they were specifically homeland trips through the adoption agency. As a child I didn't really care that it was a homeland trip, but was very excited about the prospect of going somewhere. Of traveling. So it was very much more about a touristy thing than like a *homeland* trip.",returning;connection
00:12:52.260,Mya,Is that something that you would want to do again in the future?,
00:13:01.080,Participant 002,"I think so. I'd like to go back, but definitely just as a visit. I am very leery of the Chinese government--but we dont' have to go into that. I would like to visit again now that I can appreciate more, but I am not an adoptee that wants to stay in China.",returning;connection
00:13:19.680,Mya,What do you think of the terminology of calling it like a 'homeland' trip; does does that resonate with you?,
00:13:49.350,Participant 002,"I've never really thought of it actually. It's always been a homeland to me because that's what it's called in the brochures and we got, like as children, these little travel books and it always says 'homeland trip'. It's definitely not home to me, but I don't necessarily object to the term.",returning;connection
00:14:04.290,Mya,"yeah are there. Like photos either of when you were adopted, or when your siblings are adopted or of these trips that you have looked at, or that your parents have put into albums or anything.",
00:14:17.280,Participant 002,"Yeah my mom used to scrapbook a lot and so all the pictures of when I and and my siblings when we are adopted and of the adoption journey are in scrapbooks. I'm not sure my first trip it's probably in a scrabook somewhere, but I don't know where--so for context my first trip, it was just me and my mom who went and then our second trip, it was the whole family, so me my siblings and both my parents, and that trip my mom had it printed as a custom picture book.",adoption-story;adoption-conversations;records-creation
00:15:05.340,Mya,Is that something that you ever like look through in you're home now?,
00:15:13.080,Participant 002,"i've looked through my-- Once I started, you know, joining these Facebook groups, I have, I went back and look through my album.",other-adoptees;adoption-story;records-interaction
00:15:22.470,Participant 002,"Not so much the trips really. I mean I checked them once--because it was a homeland trip, we were with other adoptees and one of the other adoptees a couple months ago joined SAAT and she reached out and was like 'hey did you go on this homepland trip?' and I was like 'yes.' Then she was like 'I think I was on there with you' and the I checked the photo albums and there she was which was surprising, but I don't look at the trips that much, mostly my album from when I was adopted.",records-interaction;records-creation;records-content
00:16:00.270,Mya,"yeah what what is it about that album do you think that that draws you to it, or is there a particular aspect of it that you that you like, or that you appreciate.",
00:16:13.320,Participant 002,"I appreciate that my parents kept it or that  my mom made it, and she made it for all three [of us]. It has the trip from when my mom--she was the only one to go to China to get me-- I can't remember the exact reason why my dad had to stay home ,but it's probably something to do with looking after my older sister. But anyway, so [the album shows] when she left, when they adopted me, and then the first I guess couple months of when I was home with all the pictures of my relatives with me as a child and I don't know it's cute. And yeah I appreciate my parents--I mean my mom, although I'm sure if my dad had any artistic skills he'd do it-- But I appreciate my mom putting it together because I don't remember, obviously, and I think it's nice to look back and be able to see what is really like basically the start of my life.",records-creation;records-meaning;records-interaction;records-use;records-retention
00:17:16.920,Mya,Is that something that you ever like verbally talk to them about too or that you've talked to them in the past about? Their experiences?,
00:17:28.290,Participant 002,Not exactly so I actually also worked at an adoption agency as an admin assistant as a part time job in university.,adoption-industry
00:17:36.180,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:17:39.030,Participant 002,"Which was very interesting being on the administrative side of it. I wasn't like--As an admin assistant all I did was be like 'Send me your documents', I wasn't the main point of contact or anything but it was really interesting to see kind of the behind the scenes--but that's when I--as people were sending me their home studies and all these adoptive parents sending me that sort of thing, that's when I got curious [about my own papers] and my mom --like all of my adoption documents are at home--and my mom showed us where it was, and she was just like you can look at it whenever you want'. I don't understand the stories were some adoptees have been locked out of their files it baffles me.",adoption-industry;records-awareness;records-content;records-access
00:18:11.940,Participant 002,"But anyways um. I knew where it was, I just didn't ever really look at it. Like it has like --it's a folder of not just the adoption documents, it's like identity documents too, like SIN card and citizenship sort of thing.",records-interaction
00:18:36.660,Participant 002,"But anyway I looked at it when I was working, because after seeing other parents, other adoptive parents' home studies, I got curious about my parents, so I went and I looked and read it, and I learned some new things about my parents that i'm not going to go into.",records-awareness;other-adoptees;records-content;adoption-story
00:19:03.540,Participant 002,But it was very interesting because I never really asked them. yeah like not explicitly.,adoption-conversations
00:19:03.540,Mya,"How was it finding out that the there was like I guess information, specifically that they would have provided in the process of adopting you that you that you didn't know before.",
00:19:30.030,Participant 002,"It was weird because I am a big proponent of 'adoptees should have have access to their documents', however, the home study that you were required to do, it's not about me really and it's like it's part of the adoption documents and, like my parents were kind of like 'you can read, if you want' sort of thing right. But it was odd because, as I was reading it, it wasn't information about me, it's about my parents. And like. It just felt odd kind of knowing this personal stuff that is in there. But then I was also looking through my documents too and that was interesting",records-access;records-content;records-interaction;records-ownership
00:20:06.000,Mya,How so?,
00:20:24.420,Participant 002,"Well, first of all I confirmed what my Chinese name characters were, because in Chinese school we had like, as a child they would have you paint these characters and then be like 'write your Chinese name on it,' and I was never--when I started kind of learning Mandarin and learning about how every time every possible sound could be like one of forty or something I was like 'Hmm... I should check this'. And then I was like Like 'Okay, they didn't tell me the wrong thing.' There was a slight panic when, on the painting, one of the characters is traditional and not simplified and I was like 'it's wrong!' but it's not wrong. So I was like 'good.' And then I found-- I don't have an adoption and abandonment certificate, so I have no idea about like when I found or where anything like that, but I found a medical report that says, I was under a month when I first came to the orphanage and I didn't know that before and I was like 'wow I was there, a lot longer than I thought I was.",names;records-absence;records-content;records-interaction
00:21:40.380,Mya,"Was that disorientating isn't the right word but that that you would be learning that type of information about your story from a piece of paper, rather than like from your parents?",
00:22:02.190,Participant 002,"yeah I mean, they would have told me if I bothered asking them. But I felt that I didn't necessarily want them to tell me, I guess, I wanted to see myself. So I wouldn't have asked my parents anyway. It was--you're right it's not that it was disorienting--but it was weird, I guess, finding this kind of personal information about what you have no memory of and like going 'huh, this happened.'",adoption-story;records-access;adoption-conversations;records-content;records-use
00:22:41.490,Mya,"When you see that you would you would have wanted to found it like that information this way is that just because of the, I guess, perceived objectivity of of what it would be on paper versus your parents telling you?",
00:22:51.840,Participant 002,I think so. yeah i'm a read it person.,truthfulness-and-accuracy;records-content;records-use
00:23:10.050,Mya,"I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk a little bit more about your experience working at an option agency. What made you or drew you to decide to work there to begin with, is it the same agency that your mom worked for?",
00:23:26.970,Participant 002,"yeah and it's also the agency I was adopted from and the executive director at the time was a family friend who still works there, and so I was given the job. I'm not sure if out all the candidates, I was perhaps most qualified, but they knew I had a personal connection and they thought it would probably be better. I mean, I did not want to work retail or customer service. And when my mom was like you go work here, I was like yes it's an office, I can be bored I don't care I just don't want to [work customer services].So it would not have been my first idea of a part time job but they were very flexible hours, I didn't work that much, so....",adoption-industry
00:24:37.620,Mya,didn't do you think your emotional experience of even just being an admin is different because of the fact that you were adopted him because you were so like emotionally I guess tied to also like people working in the organization.,
00:24:50.940,Participant 002,"It definitely--Before then I didn't really think of my adoption that much. But when I was working there you know, doing all the papers, post-placement reports, talking to all of these families who couldn't sign a paper properly... Don't get me started. I worked there for three years, and so, by the end of it, there were a couple families who had just started at the process when I started and at the end had adopted a child. And was... Not fun, but it was cool to see. So this was this one also before I really thought about you know the whole ethics of international adoption, but part of having worked there, I think, is why, I can't be one of those adoptees who straight out hates it.Because I see families getting made, right? And you can... People can say what they want about you know how the origins of this is pretty terrible right, but I don't know, you read the homestudy about how much these people want children.",adoption-industry;records-awareness;adoption-perspective;records-content
00:26:16.650,Mya,yeah. ,
00:26:23.580,Participant 002,"And I can't, I am not an adoptee who is like vehemently, vehemently against international adoption. I don't think it should be the primary option, of course, I do think there are a lot better options before international adoption, but I am not one of those gung ho against it. And I think part of it is from when I was working there, you know, and seeing families being made. And I have overall a good adoption experience, so I think it can be a good thing.",adoption-perspective
00:27:05.640,Mya,"Do you find that the the amount of...Or do you think I guess, not necessarily find because you might not know, that the sort of emotional investment that you had in comparison to the emotional investment that someone who works at like a very large bureaucratic adoption agency would be equivalent.",
00:27:41.550,Participant 002,"I definitely think there would be a difference. So the Adoption Agency, I worked at--I mean international adoption in general has decreased drastically, so like were, I think, five other people, and me? Maybe not even. Okay, no five. And then like some people who were like contract workers for like translations and stuff. It was very small and I think, four out of the five were adoptive parents. There was some staff turnover when I was there, some people left to pursue other employment, but, at the time when I first started, I think the only person that wasn't an adoptive parent was social worker or training to be a social worker. But, yeah, so I do think you know working at this, you know, small Adoption Agency versus like Holt or something [is a different experience].",adoption-industry;other-people
00:28:50.250,Mya,"did your experience, I guess, of seeing. The the myriad of documents that that other families that other children would have, like I know you mentioned that sort of the difference in your experience of the the home assessment...Did that make you wish that you had other documents or the other documents that you saw that you know that you don't have?",
00:29:25.260,Participant 002,"Yeah so the abandonment certificate is one of them. And like, it's practically nothing. I've seen other people--my younger sister actually has one and it's basically nothing. They like [say] 'this baby was found on the side of this road on this day, her with her birthday is this.' That like, that's pretty much it right? But I think... I don't know, it is something I wish I would have, because the earliest thing I have is a medical exam in the orphanage I think, so I do wish I had that... I'm trying to think. I worked primarily with.the chinese adoption program at that agency they also had programs to South Korea, Thailand, India and the States at the time and I didn't really work with those documents, it was mainly China and a bit of Thailand. But, at the time, I believe, South Korea.Either South Korea or Thailand, I don't remember which one, had--It wasn't just like reports of like their medical reports, it was 'this baby is a happy baby who likes this' sort of thing, and I can't remember which country that was actually um, but it was I don't think it was China And it was something... like that would have been nice to have ",records-absence;records-desired;records-content;other-adoptees;records-awareness
00:31:04.440,Mya,Was there any information that you've I guess heard that was transferred between the orphanage that you were at or the folks that you were cared by to your parents or I guess to your mom since she's the one who physically went to get to you?,
00:31:29.460,Participant 002,"Yeah so because I don't have an abandonment certificate, I did ask after I went through these documents, I did ask my parents, I was like 'did they tell you anything? You know about where I was found?' In the scrapbooks she wrote out what county they told her I was found in but when I asked her you know 20 years later, she was like 'I don't think they told me anything.'So the county thing was kind of a fluke, I was flipping through the album again...",records-absence;records-content;information-limits;information-loss
00:32:14.160,Mya,"Is it, not frustrating, but I guess it does it evoke some kind of emotion that there is potentially some information that is just sort of lost to time?",
00:32:14.160,Participant 002,"Yeah, I mean not really frustrating because I don't really think about it because I don't necessarily need that information. But it's kind of annoying that I don't have a Canadian birth certificate, but also with all of this bureaucracy stuff, from all of the posts that I've seen about about American adoptees, I just use my citizenship and it's good, no one asks me anything, I don't know what how your bureaucracy works, I don't know why replacing stuff and so expensive. Anyways tangent. But yeah it does it does kind of make me sad that I can't know this stuff if I wanted to.",information-limits;records-content;records-absence;records-desired;other-adoptees
00:33:19.830,Mya,"In general, like even if it's not a need to have a document or a need to have documentation, would you say that that actually supersedes like in your mind the the want of having it?",
00:34:00.810,Participant 002,"Yeah, I mean I only looked at this stuff because I saw other people having it and I was like I should check. I don't think about it on it on a daily basis. I think about it if I see a post in SAAT about it, or if I I have to--this won't come upagain for a whiel because I have a ten-year passport, whenever I have to apply for passport again and gather all this stuff, I'll probably think of it. So when I do think about it a it does make me sad, but it is not, however, a constant thought.",adoption-centrality;records-absence;records-interaction;records-meaning
00:34:38.160,Mya,What would you say that generally your sort of identity as an adoptee is more latent than it is active or has that changed because of your involvement with SAAT?,
00:34:50.640,Participant 002,"It definitely changed when I started joining social groups. Sometimes the groups depress me.Like, I get it, but they depresse me sometimes but yeah I do think it has changed. It's never been necessarily an intro point of mine right? I don't... maybe when I was little and I thought it was cool right. But I've stopped that. I don't disclose it ever unless it comes up for whatever reason. And then I have also not gotten the weird questions that a lot of people in SAAT have, so it's not... I do think how I see myself as an adoptee has changed, especially as I have learned more about, you know ,the adoption system in itself and sort of the process. And you know that I have I read a lot of--not a lot--but I've read books about it, you know China's Hidden Children, One Child, that sort of thing, which has educated me on stuff I didn't know so it's definitely changed my perception of this whole thing, but I would also say it is kind of a you know latent identity, I don't dwell on it that often unless I have to or something reminds me of it.",adoption-centrality;other-adoptees;adoption-media 
00:36:31.620,Mya,"And what about your experience of being Chinese? As you've moved from being a child, as part of a family unit that very clearly is transracial in its composition, and into being your own adult person, has your relationship with identifying as Chinese or as Asian changed?",
00:36:42.720,Participant 002,"I have never been an adoptee who wished they were white or even thought they were white.Because it hasn't been my experience, I can't relate at all, like I don't understand it. But I have always known I was Chinese and I always have--it's not my first point of identification, I do tend to say I'm Canadian first. And then, if it has to be more specific, I do say Chinese Canadian, but again I don't bring up the adoptee thing unless I have to. [I'm from somewhere that is] relatively multicultural, though not as much as [other places in Canada] but I lived in like a more white area, or like we had we had students of color but they weren't East Asian. So my first Chinese friend whose parents were immigrants wasn't until I was in high school. I think, at some point, I told him I was adopted because he said something, which I can't remember at all what it was, but he probably said something about this strictly immigrant second gen Chinese Canadian thing that I have no idea what you're talking about. I think he knew, but it was a strange experience, I guess.",birth-culture;sticking-out;asian-diaspora
00:39:29.460,Mya,"Do you find that that disconnect between like being able to identify racially with someone or I guess somewhat culturally with someone, but then to not share the same experiences affects like your sense of identity in any way, or is it just kind of the facts of life?",
00:40:02.910,Participant 002,"A bit of both. It is kind of facts of life in terms of... I've never ever been insecure about being Chinese because although I don't know Chinese, I was born in China. But there have definitely been moments where I felt ostracized. So when I was in university, I met two other my friends who also were second gen Chinese Canadian but their parents, I believe both of them are from Hong Kong, and at some point we went to one of their their houses and their parents who I don't think English... like English was obviously not their first language I don't think they were very good at it, spoke Cantonese the entire time. And I was... so their son could understand them, I'm not entirely sure how much, my other friend could understand them, I think that she could a little., or enough to get the gist of it, but I was just sitting there.",birth-culture;sticking-out;asian-diaspora
00:41:08.220,Participant 002,"At one point they asked me or like [my friends] was like, 'hey [NAME], they want to know, can you speak Cantonese?' 'No.' 'Can you speak Mandarin?' 'No.' And they're like, 'Okay.' And then they didn't switch languages still and it was so awkward. ",
00:41:11.790,Mya,"Yeah,it sounds like it.",
00:41:34.200,Participant 002,"Like it was really strange being in their house because... I don't even know how to describe it, it was just very Chinese Canadian. And like I didn't necessarily feel less Chinese, but I did feel kind of ostracized.",
00:41:50.130,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:41:55.890,Participant 002,"And I mean I don't necessarily blame them for not switching into English, but it was really awkward.",
00:42:07.170,Mya,"I was curious, since you mentioned--This is not entirely related, but it is because of the thread of my brain... So where you were born was is that a predominantly Cantonese speaking area?",
00:42:28.470,Participant 002,I don't think so. It's not southern China. Jiangsu I don't think it is. I mean it is kind of south but it's not like Guangdong.,
00:42:46.740,Mya,"um, I guess, I was just thinking when you were mentioning before that seeing your records and seeing the documents with your name like written out with the characters and knowing 'okay, they had been telling me the right thing'...Is the accuracy of either your knowledge or of the documents in terms of the relation of your origins, is that important to you?",
00:43:23.310,Participant 002,"Kind of in that it would be great, I would really like it to be accurate. But I am also... As I learn more and more about the one child policy and this whole thing, I am not necessarily completely upset about the possibility of it not being true I guess. So here's the thing about not having abandonment certificate: they didn't make anything up, which is typically how it is, and then, of course, my name was given to me by the orphanage so they made it up, it's not like I knew what it was before. So yeah, it would be really great if it was accurate--I haven't heard any report of the orphanage I was from being one of those very fraudulent ones. But I also am kind of under the position of: 'these are the documents, they're as true as you want them to be.' Some adoptees are really, really bothered about the uncertainty. They're really, really bothered about you know, not knowing their birthday sort of thing or maybe they're from an area where the orphanage was known for trafficking. I get it, but I have never really felt that way so i'm kind of 'These are the documents.' So they're as concrete as I'm going to get. No finding location, which I guess was mostly made up for a lot of adoptees, and with a birthday, who knows anyway? So I was like them to be accurate, but...",truth-and-accuracy;records-content;created-facts;other-adoptees;records-meaning;information-limits;adoption-industry;names
00:45:16.350,Mya,"Do you I mean obviously you don't need them need them in your everyday life, because you have Canadian documents, but do you view them with a similar level of weight in terms of their I guess.Contract contraction of view you as a legal person or. ",
00:45:37.440,Participant 002,"I think so. Like i've never really thought about it like that, but I would say so, because these are.You know the earliest records of myself. mm hmm right so yeah they're not necessarily useful as, on the other documents, but I do think they're important to me.",records-use;records-meaning
00:46:02.610,Mya,"I guess, conversely, would you say they have more meaning in their existence than some of the Canadian ones that you have.",
00:46:17.040,Participant 002,"I think so. The Canadian document share are from a known period of my life, and these are from unknown. And it's also a bit of 'if they're destroyed and a fire or something, how easy would it be to get them back?'",records-access;records-meaning
00:46:24.720,Mya,Sure yeah yeah.,
00:46:24.720,Participant 002,The answer: Not eally easy.,records-access
00:46:24.720,Mya,"I know that you mentioned that your mom was very open in terms of being like 'here's your folder, this is where it is, you're welcome to look at it anytime'-- Is there ever a point in your life, where you think you would want to be the person who hold on to them like generally?",
00:47:02.910,Participant 002,"Yeah. I mean, not right now--I'm kind of in a transient state part of my life, but once I get you know a more permanent thing, I would like to have them myself. I'm not in a rush to do it. I know my parents would let me have it--I've even looked at my siblings', although maybe I shouldn't have, but they're all there. But yeah so at some point, I would like to have the myself but I'm not worried about having them stay with my parents.",records-ownership
00:47:50.190,Mya,Is there a sense of is it just a matter of like the stability of your living situation that would change that or is or is there like an emotional aspect of like 'okay once i'm officially an adult' or something like that is when I should have them?,
00:47:59.670,Participant 002,"Yeah both. I'm not planning on being where I am permanently or anything. So I would like to be somewhere where i'm like 'I am planning on staying longer term in this place'. And yeah, it is a bit of 'oh my God i'm i'm going to be an actual adult.' I mean, I am fully above 18 by couple years, but yet...",records-ownership
00:48:25.740,Mya,"yeah. um you mentioned like having taken a peek I guess sort of I at your siblings records is is adoption, something that you've talked to them about all that much I mean obviously it's something that you all share, but at the same time, is it just sort of something that you find like other outlets to sort of talk to about and not within your family?",adoption-conversations;other-adoptees
00:49:06.810,Participant 002,"I don't really talk to them about it. There been like a vague surface conversations that come up very rarely, not that much now that we're all in different places but we all used to have dinner together when we were all in the same home sort of were things and on occasion, very rarely, it would come up. When China channged their one child policy, I wrote a feelings piece about it and I send it to [an adoption organization] and had it [made public], which I was very nervous to do, but I showed my parents and then they were like 'can we send it to you know to your family?' and i'm like 'yes', so my siblings, my younger sibling didn't say everything and I don't even know if they read it, but my older sister read it and was kind of like 'I didn't know you feel that way' and some other messages. But yeah  I don't know if my younger sister does anything adoption related, my impression is no, but I know my older sister, she also volunteered at the adoption agency as an adoptee mentorm, so I know she probably has thought about it more that I know of because we don't really talk about it.", other-adoptees;adoption-media;adoption-conversations
00:50:44.430,Mya,"How much would you say you know about their stories, as well as that something that or I guess they know of yours is that something that sort of overlaps a lot when you were kids or is it kind of.",
00:50:58.680,Participant 002,"I know the city. I know, like what cities they were from and I know the approximate age at which they were adopted. We have their photo albums too. And like my younger sister has an abandonment certificate, I do know that. But yeah no I don't know about other stuff. I did I went through a very--I'm still kind of in a period of being very interested in in Chinese names, I think their naming practices are cool. Just how like their language kinda lends itself to these really like, well typically how they advertise themselves as really meaningful names. And then I'm very fascinated by how adoptees named themselves. So like I looked up you know my siblings' Chinese names because I was curious.",birth-culture;names;records-content
00:52:09.450,Mya,Is your and/or your siblings Chinese names part of your legal names?,
00:52:09.450,Participant 002,"Yeah all of us. So my older sister, her Chinese name is two characters so last name first name, so in her middle name they have both. For me and my younger sister, our names were three characters so family name and then two syllable first names. And so we only have our first names. I'm also a little annoyed because, so the way my parents filled it out on the forums that they're two separate words, and you know with a Chinese name it really twould have been one word. But you know there's all this debate about how to romanize thing and they've only kind of hammered it out into Pinyin but it's still not really right, so like I don't blame them, but what I learned, when I was renewing my passport by myself, for the first time, because you know before my parents handled it, I realized that on a lot of my federal documents, they are two separate words, but then on a lot of my provincial documents, there there's a hyphen.",records-content;truth-and-accuracy;names;birth-culture
00:53:27.930,Participant 002,"Yeah so some of them and some of them don't. And I'm like 'will this affect me?'. A hyphen's better than a misspelling right? But i'm a little like, 'Pick one!' But yeah so our names are our legal middle name, and I do think that's how it should be. I am always kind of baffled when I here of adoptees whose parents were like 'throw it out'.",names;birth-culture
00:54:03.270,Mya,"yeah yeah it's interesting so in sort of a an interesting turn of events, because you came from the same orphanage Does that mean that you and your younger sibling have the same Chinese last name.",
00:54:15.390,Participant 002,"Yes, but I mean it's also when I've looked up how Chinese last names work it's not....",names
00:54:15.390,Participant 002,"Anyway, Both me and her have the same Chinese last name",names
00:54:26.580,Mya,Interesting.,
00:54:33.480,Participant 002,"I like my younger sisters name it's nice. Yeah, pretty.",names
00:54:33.480,Mya,Do you not like yours as much?,
00:54:41.010,Participant 002,"Well, I mean I like it, and I think it's not as girly, I guess as some of the other names I've seen. Not that there's anything wrong with them being very feminine right. But what I have noticed is that the only time--First of all, the characters they use, I did some Mandarin lessons very briefly last year during the pandemic and I asked my teacher about it and they were like, 'it sounds like a scholar named you' because one of the characters is kind of a literary word, so you wouldn't normally use it--they were like 'it was probably a doctor or something,' which could check out, you know. But I also noticed that I *never* see people and, like I watch a lot of like Chinese variety shows and idol competition shows,and all of the contestants I guess are around my age and I have not seen a single person with with the first character at all. And then the second character I've only seen for boys.",names;birth-culture;sticking-out;other-people
00:55:50.340,Mya,Interesting yeah.,
00:55:56.160,Participant 002,"I know I've read that with Chinese names, you know, sometimes like a girl would be given manly names for strength and whatnot, so it's not like... I've seen some other adoptees who have like *manly* names, but I'm like 'interesting' that I've never seen anyone with some of the characters of my name.",names;birth-culture;sticking-out
00:56:26.190,Mya,Does it feel... Nice or alienating that your name is unique in that way?,
00:56:53.910,Participant 002,"A bit of both because I like the meaning, I like that it's not plant-based. Plant-based names are very beautiful I really like the name Iris, I would totally name my child Iris if I wanted to. I think they're nice. But, I do like the the meaning of mine, but I do think it's a little weird that I've never seen anyone with it.",names;birth-culture;sticking-out
00:57:09.630,Mya,yeah. ,
00:57:19.260,Participant 002,"Because it does feel, I mean the way... Like in China, you have common characters, but the way they make their names, you could [have a situation where] it sounds like your name, but characters are wildly different. But it is a little weird that I've only ever seen the second character in names. And only in guys.",birth-culture;names;sticking-out
00:57:46.740,Mya,"Do you think that. It's very speculative of me to ask this, but  do you think that says something about how the orphanage was naming?",
00:58:04.110,Participant 002,"I have no idea because I did ask the other people in my adoption group, you know, what their Chinese name was, But, I did want to press, so they didn't necessarily tell me their meeting. So I don't really know. All I know is that my younger sister, I like her name",names;other-adoptees
00:58:35.850,Mya,"yeah it's it's something that i've been thinking about like with my name as well because it's not uncommon to see the same like romanization of it, but again like I've never seen someone with those like exact characters and have that be a name. So it's sort of a weird thing of both having a name that fits in and it's not just you know, one of the transliterations of have an English name into Chinese and yet at the same time, it sometimes feels just as like I'm not I'm not normal.",
...,,,
00:59:37.830,Mya,"Looking back at all of the I guess sort of cultural education that you did when you were younger and sort of comparing it to efforts that you've taken on now. Would you say that the experience--for example, like when you were taking Mandarin last year--felt more weighty in a way, than when you were being sort of pushed into it when you're a kid?",
01:00:40.710,Participant 002,"Yeah. Because now, this was you know, an active choice as opposed to you know your parents put you in. It's a weird mix of 'I kind of wish they had made me stay' versus 'I'm glad they didn't make me stay.' Because, darn it, I would have hated it, you know. But yeah I do think you know the culture seeking activities I've taken since the pandemic started were more meaningful than the ones, my parents put me in.",birth-culture;connection
01:01:16.980,Mya,"Oh, and I just remembered another question that I have for you, which was so you mentioned writing that that sort of feelings piece, that the sort of thought piece. Have you otherwise ever, like when you were younger or now, created art or writing or other sort of types of documents or like works related to your adoption?",
01:01:37.950,Participant 002,"Not really when I was younger unless it was like an assignment or something I was prompted to do. I don't really do art. Not necessarily adoption-related, but I play an instrument and I have tried to play more Chinese songs but that's also mix of, I also have started to play some anime songs, so it's not necessarily about adoption, it's more I like the music. I have written... Are you in CCI?",adoption-media;birth-culture;other-adoptees
01:02:12.450,Mya,No.,
01:02:12.450,Participant 002,"No okay well, they have an initiative where they have adoptee reviews. So for example, you could say I watched 'Found' or that sort of thing. So I have written a couple things like 'I liked the book' for them.",adoption-media
01:02:41.100,Mya,"So, have you consumed, a lot of the like media that's been coming out lately that.",
01:02:49.530,Participant 002,"I prefer books for that. I was thinking about watching Found, but I don't know, everyone else said they cried. I don't think I would cry, but there's something that I consider very deeply personal about adoption that I don't think I would be comfortable actively watching someone's adoption journey or searching journey. I watched Twinsters because someone told me I should, but like I will be sticking books. I just...it's weird because you know there's the whole representation thing, of adoptees, but it's also like, 'I don't want to watch.'",adoption-media;other-adoptees
01:03:38.430,Mya,"Speaking of searching, I feel like that ends up being a lot of the focus of the Facebook group posts is that something that you've ever wanted to do that you've ever done.",
01:03:51.420,Participant 002,"Not seriously. And also not actually. I don't really want to, because I feel like there's so much emotional labor you have to put into it. And right now, it doesn'tnecessarily feel worth it to me, I think the most I would ever do is do a DNA test like 23andme or something. I don't like private DNA tests, they're kind of [iffy] to me and so like, it's a whole catch 22 because you do it to find relatives, but I also don't want people finding me. All the advice I got the advice of when you're actually searching of: do the DNA tests and upload it to this database and uploade to these databases, some of which aren't in North America, some are China, and I'm like, 'uh, no'. So no, I have not searched. I'm not currently planning to, and I think the most I'd ever do if I ever will is a DNA test, but I don't think I go further than that, unless there's like a miracle.",DNA-testing;finding-family;other-adoptees
01:05:06.780,Mya,Is that something that you find to be rare within the the sort of folks that you talk to?,
01:05:26.670,Participant 002,"Well, I find out rare in these Facebook groups, but I also think you know, there are certain type of people who search out these Facebook groups.",other-adoptees;finding-family
01:05:37.260,Participant 002,"I don't think either of my siblings care. And I have adoptee friends who I've met who have zero interest. So I don't necessarily think these Facebook groups are, you know, representative. There, was a post a couple months ago actually, that was like 'why don't you want to search?' And I was like, 'oh they are more of us than I thought there were in this group' But there were some people in the the comments who were like,'I didn't want to search either, but I changed my mind' and i'm like, 'This post isn't for you' And they're like 'maybe you'll change your mind later' and i'm like. 'Okay?' So yeah.",other-adoptees;finding-family
