00:01:48.930 ,Participant 003,"Oh, I have one of those family registration things. It looks exactly like the one I have.Really yeah actually exactly like it. I get I get what she means... I wouldn't necessarily say that I feel so strongly about it but that's interesting I didn't know that. They did it so you basically would be unrecognizable. I guess that's a little sad but I don't know I mean, I guess, I get it if, if you want to adopt away your child, they're not really supposed to be on your lineage. So yeah I don't know, that's funny I didn't I didn't know that a lot of people had this thing, but I also have one of these things actually also with the same permanent address. Yeah, so I think it's Holt's address. So yeah that's interesting. I get what she means, I just don't feel i'm that much of an orphan. With the barest of social identities in Korea..",adoption-records;records-content; records-content;records-awareness
00:04:20.310 ,Mya,How important or not important is the idea of having like an accurate record of your past to you.,
00:04:30.810 ,Participant 003,"Well, I think what I call it was accurate enough for me to not be like super interested in it. And like obviously I still have some questions, but they are more so not like they're they're more so, something you would ask your mom about and not really you know consult your adoption papers about.So yeah I think that's fine. I think my records are quite boring really. If they said a little bit more about my mom you know when I didn't know her that would have been better. Some basic description of like the household she was in and like did she like basketball, did you play the guitar you know, like just some small effects, and I think that would have brought a lot of comfort to me when I was very little. And to a lot of other people I guess.",truth-and-accuracy;records-content;records-use;records-desired

00:05:46.260 ,Participant 003,"Well, in a utopia, they would be made for adoptees, but it's not really like that because in most cases, you know the birth parents also don't really want to be found. So, to be honest, I kind of feel like it's mostly just made for either bureaucracy purposes or you know for for adoptive parents to have something fun to flip through.",records-use;records-desired
00:06:18.810 ,Mya,"Does that.make you feel any certain way, or is it just kind of what it is.",
00:06:24.240 ,Participant 003,Like the last part of it or.,
00:06:25.890 ,Mya,"yeah that if it's not meant for you, but it's about you...",
00:06:33.090 ,Participant 003,"I mean,I don't know. I mean, to be honest, I I don't know It depends on I guess from my standpoint how your parents treat the issue. And how how they frame it. For me, I would have liked that you know they will more easily obtainable by the one it was actually about because itt was very hard to like a get a second copy of my papers when like my mom wouldn't hand me like do original ones, so it definitely isn't made for the adoptee. I'm pretty sure adoption papers are made to fucking confuse us, so...",records-access;records-ownership;
00:07:27.660 ,Mya,"I'm thinking about your experience with Holt and was trying to contact them and to get like a just information, especially when you were younger before you were an adult were you like discouraged by your experience that you had to be so persistent in trying to reach out to them.",
00:07:44.190 ,Participant 003,"Oh yeah definitely definitely they really didn't want to hear from me. But you know they get a lot of like you know emails like this and phone calls like that, so I kind of get it, because you, you can't find every single parent for every single child and that's also not really, you know, their job, the job is to adopt children out and they do so very, very successfully so...",post-adoption-services
00:08:10.530 ,Mya,"I guess another way to look at it, as if they're putting all that work into adopting everyone out shouldn't take the.",
00:08:18.300 ,Participant 003,"I think they should give people better pay, because what I've seen from my personal experience and like what I seen on TV because there are actually have a quite a few documentaries also about like Korean  adopted to Denmark like trying to go back to Korea and like finding their birth parents... I think they should get more social workers, because obviously people are going to come back when they are adults or even minors and they are going to try to find their birth parents and they need to be ready for that demand. And I just know beyond they aren't. And they also don't speak English very well. I mean I get it's annoying that you know so many people call them, so many people email, but I kind of feel like that's what you sign up for when you became an adoption agency, obviously the adption agency is the first place people are going to look. So if they could just you know hire more people, because the ones I talked to what have just seemed incredibly... like very, very unsympathetic and just very tired and very off... very robotic.",other-people;post-adoption-services
00:09:44.910 ,Mya,"What about when you.When your mom got that call.for you to stop trying to contact the hospital and things like that?",
00:10:00.840 ,Participant 003,"Oh well, I would say, you know, to be honest, I didn't really care about that. I was just annoyed my mom was bugging me about it, because you know she was one who didn't want to give me the papers in the first place. I made a huge mess about it, and you know I think I think it's my right to know where I come from, if you if you wanted a child that didn't want to know stuff like that maybe you should have even not adopted or you should you should have gotten a child it looked like you.know because obviously i'm going to ask questions and my mom has been very annoying throughout the process, when I was younger so, to be honest, it didn't it didn't really.You know I guess I didn't really care what you bought or what they fought, and I still believe it's every person's right to to know whether from.",records-access;records-use
00:11:06.930 ,Mya,"Switching to another track, you were mentioning that it's not super important necessarily for you to have the records be completely accurate just because there are things that you can ask your mom and that relationship is sort of more important than than what's actually on paper.",
00:11:27.090 ,Participant 003,"Well, I wouldn't say I don't care about them being accurate, I care about what is in it being accurate. I also heard some horror stories about just, you know, made up shit but that mostly happens when when you know you get dropped off at an orphanage and you don't see who's dropping the kid off or like in China, where they have a lot more adoptees, I think. But no, there are just just things that I don't necessarily think that you should write about in an official paper. Like some of the things that can just ask my mom about, some things might be hard for her to her to talk about, so you know I would rather just try to speak to her about it. One thing is looking at a piece of like bureaucratic paper work and [it's another thing to] have an actual conversation with your parents.",
00:12:28.530 ,Mya,"When you've had those conversations, or when you sort of learned something about like your past or or your mom Have you ever felt like.You wanted to write it down that you want it to have some sort of document that that saved that, even if it wasn't an official and or is it more of just knowledge in your head.",
00:12:52.470 ,Participant 003,"Just knowledge in my head. Before I found my mom hey you know what I knew about it was just etched into my brain, I don't think I would ever be able to forget anything I found out about my mom. It was like inked into my brain so, no, I never really thought about that.",records-meaning;records-creation
00:13:14.490 ,Mya,"And sort of to dovetail off that like we talked last week about the fact that so much for your contact with your mom has been digital.",
00:13:24.240 ,Participant 003,"Yes, all of it.",
00:13:25.050 ,Mya,"Does a physical record, like something that you can hold in your hands or something that you know you can look at the wall and see, mean something different to you than a digital one or do you experience them the same.",
00:13:39.510 ,Participant 003,"I don't know, it depends on what. I mean, I would like to have a picture of her or something that I could put somewhere, but I think it's a weird place to be in because obviously I do care about and stuff but she's just not very good intern at expressing it because we are just different and we come from different cultures. Where I come from, if you care about someone or if you love someone you say it outright. But she's more like, she will asked me randomly if i'm okay, or if i'm eating and stuff like that instead. So I don't know. It really depends. I still have to meet her at some point, and I also am just a bit apprehensive about that, because she does, in my opinion, seem a tad bit flaky and I don't want to be in a situation where I come, either alone or with my significant other to a country where apparently I look like everyone and everyone looks like me, but is so foreign to me... and this is supposed to be my my ancestral home or whatever, [I don't want to be in a situation where I'm there and] then you know my mom is not going to show up. I'm just a bit unsure about her, she doesn't give me the most you know 'you're safe now' feels about it to be honest. She's very to know offhand and just a bit cold I would personally say say. But you know she also just said to me that she does care about me and she's just better texting, and she kind of feels like she's just better at like speaking to someone in person, but we also really can't do that so... And she has tried calling me a couple of times now, and I have always missed it but in almost right away I've seen it and tried to like get her back on the phone, but like then she chickens out and then she doesn't want to. So it would it would really depend on you know how me and her meeting for the first time we'll go, because if she seems warm and would want a relationship with me, then I would be happy to like p a picture of her and, like her husband on the wall, but if not, then, then you know the IT and i'm just you know done. Then I don't need to hear more from her or have her in my life.",birth-culture;connection;family-ties;returning;finding-family;records-creation
00:16:16.230 ,Mya,"Is it scary that you might not have that answer, and until you actually like physically meet her.",
00:16:24.510 ,Participant 003,"I wouldn't say scary. I would say I'm a bit annoyed at her sometimes and I'm a bit annoyed that I feel like we don't communicate very clearly, and she speaks very cordially to me. I thought it would be a warmer relationship. And I know she cares about me, it just wouldn't hurt for her to show it sometimes I guess. So no I wouldn't say scared to be honest, at this point I known about her for so long, and I have tried putting effort into it and of course I want to meet her and of course it would be a dream of mine, and monumental or whatever, but at this point I'm also just kind of different about it, because you know I never you know I never felt that age to like very clearly go meet my mom and be in Korea and spend time in Korea to feel Korean. I don't even feel the need to like learn how to speak Korean. I will at some point if you know I meet her and it turns out, she she wants to have a relationship with me, then I will learn it, then I will study, day and night, and so my eyes fall out but, until then, I just don't have that gap in my identity. I feel Korean enough as is. You know I feel both things at once.",finding-family;connection;family-ties;birth-culture
00:18:07.620 ,Mya,"I think we've actually covered a lot that was in the readings just topically that makes it easy but and was there a record that you wanted to share wanted to talk about?",
00:18:19.560 ,Participant 003,"No I actually didn't ask [my mom]. I was, I actually spoke to her and I tried to and then she just started saying so some like offhand like kind of racist shit so I go kind of mad at her, and then I just told it to knock it off, and then I hung up",records-access;family-ties;records-ownership;conversation-barriers
00:18:38.040 ,Mya,"yeah that's totally fine I mean, that sort of says something in of itself... Is it frustrating to you that she has that much control over your documents?",
00:18:51.720 ,Participant 003,"Oh no,I don't really care, it was more for your sake. I'm just frustrated that she is so old and so set and her ways and just... it just annoys me because I don't think my mom is pathetic, I love my mom and I think she's very amazing in very many ways, but I think it's a very pathetic notion to just be so afraid of what you don't know anything about and then also vilify it because I grew up my entire life hearing about how South Korea was a poor country, and they saved me, and I would have ended up in an orphanage and we all worked in rice fields and there was no Internet and whatever. I come to find out where one of the most advanced countries in the entire world, and my mom didn't even like really care to like check up on it. I wasn't really that interested in Korea growing up, but it would have been nice to not have been fit misinformation my entire life, so to speak. So it just annoys me because she's just she's just who woefully ignorant at this point and it just frustrates me. She's not racist and it's not because she wants to hurt me... she just is ignorant. Like she just thinks the world is just black and white and it's just the same way as when she was young, she just can't fathom that the world is dynamic and is moving and is changing you know. So it's just frustrating because you also don't want to scold her because she's old and you don't know how many more years you have with her. And I also don't want to make her sad. I just think it's so wild to piece of willfully unaware of, like, everything around you he doesn't even know who Kim Kardashian is... not know that it's important for her existence at all. But she knows everything about Donald Trump because she's been seeing him on the news for like four years. It just it enrages me a little bit, [that she] kind of painted of where I come from as some third world country when, in reality, Korea is just so much more advanced than Denmark. We have a better system in Denmark, better opportunities, but Korea is more advanced, so I just I just you know it's... it's a great culture, I know I know many, many nice Koreans. I just think it's so stupid. She's so old fashioned",white-saviourism;birth-culture;conversation-barriers
00:21:41.580 ,Mya,"Were you ever asked to talk about Korean culture, when you were in school, like sharing.",
00:21:50.880 ,Participant 003,"Yeah I think has happened once or twice from my recollection. I remember when I was like in the kindergarten class which was basically the first year of real elementary school, my mom would like bring this picture book of some pictures of Korea, stuff like that, and some little infographics, basically a children's book. And she had like a whole hour reserved and she would tell all the people where I came from and stuff like that. But you know, even though I was six years old, it was kind of old news to me I knew where I came from. So she just basically told my all the other six year olds where I came from, and why I looked different and stuff and that I wasn't Chinese. You know there's nothing wrong with being Chinese, it's just kind of annoying to be called Chinese your entire life when you're not. So I guess my mom did, but then again she did paint it like a third world country back then too, but I think it nipped a lot of things in the bud, like a lot of maybe issues that would have been with me looking different and just being different, so I think that was the right thing to do, she's just old.want to wake her over the head with a salmon or something every time she goes off like that.",adoption-conversations;adoption-media
00:23:21.030 ,Mya,"Did you ever read that book on your own or did you ever look through it, you know.",
00:23:24.540 ,Participant 003,"Oh yeah, I look through it thousands of times. It's mostly just... I don't even know where where they took these pictures, there was a nice picture of a forest and you know some girls in hanboks. And then the only picture I really remember very clearly is just this picture of like you know do photographer standing on top of a hill then looking down and it just mostly looks like sand and desert and then maybe a few houses, like in the horizon beneath the hill and that's what I most clearly remember. There's a specific picture of like me and my foster mom which shows us looking into the camera while she's holding me, so I would, because there was so much you know like free space in the picture, I would always imagine my foster mom in the in middle of it, you know. It was nice.",other-people;adoption-media;records-interaction

00:24:37.620 ,Mya,"Were you able to look at that photo album whenever you wanted to?",

00:24:44.700 ,Mya,"Both.",
00:24:46.440 ,Participant 003,"Oh yeah definitely. I also still have some of the pictures on the Google photos on my phone. But yeah I was able to look at it whenever I wanted. I didn't really use it for anything until I was like a preteen, early teen where I would look at the hangul an stuff and try to figure out where we were. So at some point, I was able to deduce some of the places I had been as a baby in Korea by writing down the hangul and then basically just go search on like the map in Seoul just meticulously going through every single spot. So that was kind of cool I guess.",records-use;records-interaction
00:25:30.510 ,Mya,"What did it mean to you if it meant anything that you were able to have those photos to sort of start your search.",
00:25:39.660 ,Participant 003,"I think it was kind of fun. Also to just you know see me as a baby, and you know where I was before and stuff like that. When I was little I don't think it meant that much to me because when you're little nothing means that much to you, except you know your mommy or Daddy and candy maybe. But it was nice to have,I mean it meant some something to me when I started looking for my parents, but you know, I think it would have meant more to me if I had a picture of my mom.",records-desired;records-use;records-interaction
00:26:12.270 ,Mya,"Do you ever look at the copies of the photos that you have, or is it just that you have them.",
00:26:20.910 ,Participant 003,"No, I would say I'm not very sentimental. I would say the first around seven years of my life are pretty good, but then you know I don't know who screened my parents and who allowed them to adopt someone, but they were not very fit to be parents. So, like basically from eight until I gues 18, we had a very strained relationship and it wasn't that great, so I don't really if you need to look at anything with my parents. I mean my dad has scanned some old photo albums and now I think it's kind of fun when it's like pictures of me when I was tiny but like, no, I don't really ever look at the pictures from Korea, because you know I looked at them so many times, I can remember so many of them anyway. I can remember the first picture I saw my mom, I can remember the little statues close to where like I lived. So I can remember a lot of it it's just you know in my brain because I've seen so many times.",records-interaction;records-use;records-meaning
00:27:29.910 ,Mya,"Do you remember when you took the photographs of the photographs and why?",
00:27:38.820 ,Participant 003,"I actually think it was because I had a boyfriend wanted to see them. Because he wanted to see what it looked like when I was little, and I also showed it to a couple of people.  We still have [the album] somewhere, it's just kind kind of like compact and heavy, so I don't want to go around with it also just because those are original pictures from my childhood, those are the only copies we you know we have. I'm not one to misplace or lose things, I'm just really afraid because you know the plausibility is always there.", records-creation;records-use;records-meaning;information-loss
00:28:19.200 ,Mya,"And even even though you have a digital copy the physical original means something to you?"
00:28:26.100 ,Participant 003,"yeah I definitely think it's like a fun little photo album. I mean I would definitely say that the photo album means a lot more to me than like the other ones that my parents have made. Definitely, definitely I would save that you know fire over any of the others",records-meaning
00:28:53.610 ,Mya,"sort of a weird exercise, but can you describe it to me.",
00:28:57.600 ,Participant 003,"Basically it's a very thick phonebook with individual pages. It has kind of like a... I don't know how you would say that... So there's a picture in the middle and then almost kind of like a frame and it's basically like full-on silver and  it glistens and it's kind of like an intertwining twig or like a tree or something. And then there's just a lot of pictures inside this is like a monster of pockets like very, very thick. I don't think I could fit any more pictures in there if I wanted to.",records-content

00:30:07.080 ,Participant 003,"I think maybe my favorite is just the first one, or maybe were like my my foster mom is holding me. Yeah I guess it's the one one my foster mom was holding me, I think that's a really nice picture. I have the front page of it here *[shows picture on phone]*. It's really nice, but that wasn't taken when I was in Korea, that was taken in Denmark",records-content

00:30:59.250 ,Participant 003,"So basically as far as I know, I came with the photo album yeah. I was brought with the photo album it was like a two for one deal. But then my family put in like more pictures into the photo album to kind of completed but they never really managed to complete it. *[flipping through photos on phone]* So, like, I would say  remember that this one is also in the photo album; it was also taken in Denmark when I was little. Oh yeah, and this is basically in the same room. I loved playing like mom and baby when I was little.",records-content;records-creation

To be honest, I don't think we could add any more pictures to it, it would burst so and it's quite old, so I would like that to not happened. That would be so so sad.

00:35:23.790 ,Participant 003,"Oh just did I need to quit it and I'm too young to do this and you know this was not funny because this was like my parents' agenda because, I remember, I was very young when I started searching for my mom so they didn't believe I was the one writing the emails because they didn't believe a foreign child who was so young could write emails, speak English, stuff like that.",finding-family;agency;post-adoption-services

00:37:23.790 ,Mya,"Do you remember who told you that?",
00:37:32.580 ,Participant 003,"I think it was like my mom or like one of the other kids. It might have been because, like to girl I was adopted with actually had some security footage from that day from the airport, where you can like see us being handed over to our parents, you can just hear me scream.just goes on and, like the other kids are sleeping and i'm just screaming basically.",records-content;records-creation;records-interaction

00:38:51.720 ,Mya,"Did you find that like watching that.Not disturbing, but like discomforting experience."
00:39:00.900 ,Participant 003,"Like see it seeing myself being handed over on camera? Oh no, I just thought it was kind of funny that the others were sleeping and I was like screaming my head off. And I because I remember the other parents looked at my parents and so she's going to be a rebel that when she is she's going to cause you guys trouble. Yeah i'm the only one in university, do you only want to finish high school um do you know, only one that didn't become completely fucked up so."
00:39:35.970 ,Mya,"Yes, I guess it's a rebel in a different way."
00:39:37.950 ,Participant 003,"Well, well, it also it also makes sense because, like the other two adoptees were kept at orphanages. I know the girl was just dropped off at the orphanage, like left on the doorstep, so it was like they could deduce some of like who the mom was and stuff from someone who had seen something around the time but, but like you know they had a lot more of my family history, because you know, they knew my mom because I was in private for foster care. And I even knew even from the beginning, she had a brother and that my dad worked in office job, and I think my grandma was cleaning or something like that, then I knew that my mom was in middle school, and it also showed me where I was born. So I was very fortunate; I don't think a lot of people are that lucky.",records-content;information-limits
00:40:49.680 ,Mya,Did it make you feel uncomfortable that or weird that you had that much more information or was it just kind of.,
00:40:58.260 ,Participant 003,"Oh no I just just always kind of knew that there was something different about the way I was adopted than the other kids. I might have been told, or something but you know, I was just aware of it from like a very early age. I can try to forward you this chain. I have an email here where I am asking if they can find my.Not my birth mom but if they can find you know my my first of all.Because I would like to like speak to.What i'll just find your email again.Oh that's Nice.",records-content;finding-family;other-people
00:42:40.410 ,Mya,You said that she passed away right your your foster mom.,
00:42:43.890 ,Participant 003,"Yeah they basically told me that they tried to get in contact with her, she didn't live at her old place but they said that basically from what they knew because she was with them for very long time, and a lot of the caseworkers knew her, that she had just passed away, unfortunately. Okay, so I send you I think two messages one email I sent and a response."

00:43:43.500 ,Participant 003,"No, I wouldn't really say so, I mean I looked at, you know the letter that they relayed from my mom when we finally got in contact. So that one I looked at several times and looked at her picture and stuff like that, but like the other ones that I wouldn't say I have after I kind of like tried to find my peace with this. I think I stopped really you know even before I turned 15 and basically at that point I was a minor and I knew it would be basically impossible also when I was on the other side of the world. [If I had been able to,] I would have probably like gone to Korea and looked further into it and, tried to find some old records and stuff like that. I would have gone to you know the hospital where I was born and or something. So I knew I couldn't do it anymore it's a minor anyway, and I was kind of okay with that because I knew I could kind of tried to do something about it when I became legal, but then you know my mom contacted me so...",post-adoption-services;records-interaction;records-access;information-limits
00:45:12.630 ,Mya,"Is there anything that you wish that you could have like told to your younger self about the process or that you could, if you went back that you would change about."
00:45:26.550 ,Participant 003,"No, I don't think so because I feel like all adoptees have to have kind of like an identity crisis about being adopted, and I think I had mine very early and kind of like just reconciled with that part of myself also very early, so I think that brought me a lot of peace inside that I feel like a lot of the adoptees that I have met, especially after turning 18 like they just don't seem to have that. THey seem  to speak a lot about not really knowing a real sense of self or where they come from and like having that gap in their life and stuff like that. So I honestly think it was just good for me to go through that because that way I also started connecting with more Asians like predominantly from the United States and stuff and also you know I still keep in contact with one of them and we've been friends for like eight years, nine years or something like that now. It's pretty amazing. So I got I got something out of it so.",post-adoption-services;finding-family;adoption-centrality;adoption-perspective;other-adoptees
00:46:38.700 ,Mya,"How did you how did you meet them? like through online forums or?"
00:46:43.650 ,Participant 003,"Oh, through Facebook. I had a friend, the friend I mentioned that had a mom that was adopted from Korea, and then you know she was curious, so she was trying to find her grandparents and she was like you know very deep into her Korean identity crisis, which actually started my own, because I was like 'Oh, am I weird because I'm not having this identity crisis' and stuff and then I just kind of started getting into it, and then I got very into it. But basically, she was a member of like some of these really cringey Facebook groups, I don't even remember what it's called, something like 'Kawaii Battle Submissions,' but you would basically post a picture of yourself and then someone would be like 'me' or like 'battle me' or something and then the moderators would like put a picture of you and the picture of the other person beside it and then people would have kind of like pick who they thought was more kawaii; it was super weird. It seemed like a good choice at the time. Yeah I was also only like 12 and 13 so like yeah, I think I can be excused. But that's basically it, so I just started friending a lot of people and talking to a lot of people so some point, I did have like a pretty large like Asian friend group.",asian-diaspora;
00:48:13.830 ,Mya,mm hmm.
00:48:14.490 ,Participant 003,"It was wild, I met some wild people from there, and had like some very wild friendships. Like I said, I still keep in contact with one one of the people I met. Like a Chinese American girl. She is actually coming to visit me , if COVID doesn't shut down the entire world again. Yeah, very excited for that"
00:49:05.580 ,Mya,yeah.
00:49:06.270 ,Participant 003,"I went to see her in America I turned 18 and it was a very wild experience for me. Also because America grew to be like a big part of my identity, even though it was just like a small town girl living in Denmark. Because you know all the Asian friends, I had were Americans. But it was pretty monumental to me. I got to go to Chicago and it was kind of nice and then you know she came to visit me in Denmark and I was also with her in Texas for a while. And then yeah, she's coming to visit me again. And the next year I'm going to New York to see her. It's really nice.",identity;asian-diaspora;connection
00:50:03.270 ,Mya,"You mentioned sort of identifying or like aligning yourself with their American this was that in lieu of or, in addition to the fact that they were also Asian."
00:50:16.500 ,Participant 003,"I don't think I would have been friends with them if they weren't Asian to begin with. Like in the beginning because I was just trying to identify with something Asian. It was just such a big part of them being American you could really feel it because... I don't know it's just you can very easily pick out the Americans in a room like you know, like the the Americans from the United States. It's very evident who they are, in the mindset and how they act and how they speak and just the general atmosphere around them and it's something that really you know infects you if you're not careful. I guess I kind of got infected with like the American dream, but the American dream is very much that so yeah and I kind of still feel that way.",connection;asian-diaspora;identity
00:51:27.090 ,Mya,"Do you find that there is a sort of essential quality to your identity, either as a Korean or as a Dane that that has a similar feel to it as as what you see in those Americans or is it just kind of specifically like there that energy that the producer."
00:51:57.360 ,Participant 003,"I guess i'm not really connected to like my Korean identity. I guess I keep the same energy about being Danish, I would say, because I'm very proud of being Danish. It's very much my entire identity. Sometimes people get  a little bit too cheeky, and I'm like 'I'm not like you guys, I'm Korean' . It's kind of unfortunate, I've lived my whole life as a Danish person in Denmark, and then I moved to [elsewhere in Europe] and then suddenly you know the coronavirus hits and suddenly I'm an Asian and people send me looks and people try to spit on me or trip me or whatever, because they don't know I'm adopted, they don't know that I'm Danish. They just see that you know I look Asian. So that's been very unfortunate. I didn't really think, like seriously think about the fact that I'm not a white person until I moved here. Like I know I'm not a white person. I always find you know looking different and being the way I am, but I very much identify with the culture I was adopted into. I think I would identify more with being Korean if, like you know about Koreans and other Asians also saw me as Asian. Because they don't really, they they see me, as you know, they see me as white.",identity;adoption-centrality;adopted-culture;asian-diaspora
00:53:37.530 ,Mya,Have they said that to your face?,
00:53:40.680 ,Participant 003,"I can feel it on them, or they won't see it directly to me, but they will just say that 'oh yeah but i'm like different'. And then, and then my Chinese American friend just straight up told me that that you know, I'm just white.",identity;adopted-culture;asian-diaspora
00:54:02.520 ,Mya,Does that offend you or make you sad or.,
00:54:05.160 ,Participant 003,"No, no, no, not at all, to be honest, I mean you know it's not really a monolith, I think the United States has a very narrow box of what they... Where I come from, because like all of the people in Europe are white, we don't really distinguish ourselves that way we distinguish us by what country we belong to, not the color of our skin. So I don't really have any problem being called white because I am, I just have a different packaging. It's just how it is. But I don't know, I mean i'm i'm fine with you know being Scandinavian, I'm fine with not being considered Asian. It's also not really my job to be Asian enough to be valid in their eyes as one of them. So yeah I feel Asian enough and I feel Danish enough, and you know that's good enough for me. It gets very confusing for people but [that's not my problem]."
