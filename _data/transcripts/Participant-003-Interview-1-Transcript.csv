00:02:42.030 ,Mya,"In general, since we don't know each other, I was wondering if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself what you're up to who you are."
00:02:50.790 ,Participant 003,"Okay sure, I was adopted from South Korea to Denmark when I was four months old. In Korea, I was not at an orphanage I was in private care with a private foster mum and then I was sent directly to Denmark, nobody came and got me, unfortunately. I grew up in like the mid-mainland of Denmark in a very small nuclear family. I have a brother, and big sister that I've never met. When I was, I think 13 or something, my parents divorced. I now have a stepmom who is German and a half Danish half German step sibling; she's about 18. My other siblings are 37 and 45 I would say, so I'm kind of the runt. I took all of my primary school education in Danish, then I took a year of Danish normal high school, which would correspond to a sophomore year in an American high school and then I did my last few years at an international boarding school, so I moved out when I was 17. I did IB, which is kind of like American AP but an entire program. After graduation, I moved in with an ex-boyfriend, we weren in Texas for short while, and then we moved back. We broke up and now I'm with my fiance of three years and we moved together in 2019 to Amsterdam, where I am now doing my bachelor's degree.",adoption-story;family-ties
00:05:09.480 ,Mya,"One of the things that I always think is interesting is a lot of people end up when they find out oh you're adopted they're like 'Oh well, you know did your parents tell you?' And yeah it's pretty obvious; there isn't really a way to to avoid knowing that you're adopted when you don't look the same as your family. Do you remember when you were sort of first told about the logistics of your adoption or the sort of adoption story that your family had?"
00:05:45.420 ,Participant 003,"Well, I don't remember being told about being adopted, but it was always very ingrained in me. I think I think I knew very, very early. I would say I would be two or so and I would already know, so they made sure to like tell me early and often so I would like be sad about it I guess? Basically I came with this little photo album from Korea with like a lot of pictures of me and my foster mom, and my parents also put some in there, so basically they would show me some of the places I'd been with my foster mum and like say to me 'Oh, this is where you come from.' But like as a child, I didn't really know much about Korea, I only knew China, so usually be kids would ask me if I was Chinese and then I would say no, and then they would ask me where I was from and I would say i'm Korean they would say 'what is that?', and I would say 'I don't know'.",adtopion-conversations;adoption-story;records-content;records-interaction;birth-culture
00:07:03.660 ,Participant 003,"It definitely think they told me, but I, I think I just don't remember.yeah for as long as I have a recollection I have always known that like I wasn't my parents biological child",adoption-story;adoption-conversations
00:07:19.620 ,Mya,"Would you say like How would you say that you were able to acquire knowledge of Korea or of the Korean culture or have you not and is that the choice that you've made intentionally?"
00:07:33.240 ,Participant 003,"Well, I know some things about Korean culture, I mean I tell people in Korean because I am.But I think growing up, I wasn't really that interested in it, I think, also it was my mom who was like very hyper focused on it, we have like an Asian cookbook and stuff like that, and my mom is just very she's not... she's not racist, that's for sure, but she's just a little bit you know, like ignorant. And she kind of has like a little bit of white savior syndrome, but you know she doesn't know what that is and it's generally not the term we would use in Denmark. But she has a bit of that so she has only like told me about oh like we all work in rice fields and we don't have Internet and stuff. But I think that's because that's what she genuinely believes. I didn't start searching out information about Korea until almost like in maybe 12 and then I got really into wanting to find my birth mom. But I think that was more of a form of like teenage rebellion. So I know ;ike some stereotypes and some basic stuff about how other people think Korean people are. I don't speak Korean I don't read hangul. But most of the stuff I knew about Korea growing up was basically you know things my mom taught me and how she saved me from a bad and dire situation.",white-saviorism;birth-culture;finding-family;
00:09:20.610 ,Mya,"When you think about how you would describe the fact that you're adopted the fact that your family adopted you obviously you wouldn't use that white savior narrative but how would you describe it?"
00:09:45.750 ,Participant 003,"Well, I don't know I don't think it has changed much. I mean, my parents are like very just Scandinavian people, and I grew up that way. So I never really viewed myself as Korean, and I just was Danish which is words.What I have heard and most other Asian adoptees do because we don't have that whole contract of like identity raise all of that in general we don't have a lot of yeah I guess normal Asian people don't want to just go there because it's hard to get a getting.In so I would just say that you know I view my parents as my parents and I when people ask me away from I say I am Danish because I am Danish.I just I never viewed my parents as anything about my my parents, I guess."
00:10:51.960 ,Mya,"i'm i'm interested in learning a little bit more about the the photo album that you mentioned um especially I guess sort of the dynamic between you looking at the photos that were added by your foster mom versus the ones that you're that your parents added to the book, do you sort of see them on I guess not unnecessarily equal levels, but do you have an attachment to the ones that maybe you sort of have memories of versus the ones that you don't or would you say that, like when you look at them that it's sort of equivalent of just all part of your your history."
00:11:31.800 ,Participant 003,"I would say it's just all part of my history, I mean the ones from before I came to them like I used at some point to find specific sites in Korea where I knew I had been. It was kind of special to me at that point to be able to see how things look today and where I used to live in Korea and stuff like that.",records-meaning;records-interaction;birth-culture;records-content
00:11:57.510 ,Mya,"um you mentioned an interest in finding your birth mom did you ever try to find your foster mom or were you able to contact her?"
00:12:05.370 ,Participant 003,"My foster mom is actually dead. I believe I was one of her last fosters because I spoke to my adoption agency in Korea about this--I was adopted through Holt international and they told me they did try to get in contact with her, but they had basically found out that she had died because she was she was a very old lady she was in her 60s when she had me, I think. So yeah she she died, unfortunately. I knew I was one of like the last batches of kids that she took care of. She lived like in a specific part of Seoul that I already knew about so that's what I know about my foster mom. My real mom I actually do know.",other-people;finding-family
00:12:59.880 ,Mya,"Can you can you talk a little bit about the process of contacting Holt?"
00:13:10.380 ,Participant 003,"Oh Holt is a mess. None them speak English that well first of all, which is a problem, and they also are not very email or tech savvy so if you do, or if your parents do if you have the money to call Korea from your phone, this is what I did. And yeah I basically just emailed them and emailed and emailed and emailed--I was about 12, 13 years old, but I already knew English at that point, but my English wasn't fluent or that great, but it was pretty conversational, so I would just email I would email the hell out of them, I would annoy them because, you know, be pushy I want to know this, be pushy. So I was pushy and they didn't really give me that much back, especially because I was a minor back then. So basically yeah, I just called and I emailed and I looked at this photo album and these pictures and try to decipher where exactly I was. There was this one photo of where my foster mom was like holding me and it looked   we were in a school, so I knew the general area where she was living. So when I was 13 I found every single school in that area and it turned out on none of them had emails and I couldn't really speak Korean ,so I was like how do I contact them?' And then I found out 'oh, we still have a fax!' and I figured out a way to set up an online fax and I faxed them, I faxed all of them, I was like 'hey, this is my name, this is a picture of me and my foster mum, is this one of like your locations?' Some of them went through some of them didn't, but my mom got a very sharp phone call from Holt to knock it off.",post-adoption-services;records-access;records-ownership;finding-family;other-people
00:15:23.940 ,Participant 003,"But, so instead my dad helped me get a new batch of my adoption papers when I was about yeah 13, 14 I would say, because my mom was very much against me doing this, but my dad was like... He was kind of just 'whatever you want, I mean whatever makes you happy do it'. It was very much like laid back, 'let's have candy for dinner' parent. And the way I did find my mom was actually about a week after I turned 18, I decided to call Holt again and I spoke to Holt. And I think I also spent like $200 or something trying to reach them and talking to different people, and then they figured out I had a caseworker assigned but apparently she wasn't working at Holt anymore, so they didn't know who to give the phone too, but, at last they promised me they would email me back, they would try to get in touch with my mom. And that actually it didn't yield any results, they just didn't have my mom's identity. So actually she found me by going to Holt.",post-adoption-services;records-access;records-ownership;finding-family
00:16:47.310 ,Mya,"So, she went to Holt and then they contacted you."
00:16:51.360 ,Participant 003,"Yeah so basically because she was so young when I was adopted, she didn't know where I was adopted through, but there are only like two really big international agencies that adopt Korean children out of the country. So the story is actually she had a friend who had to give up her baby for adoption because I think she was born out of wedlock or the mom was not financially stable or something like that. And then she wanted to know how her baby was doing, so my mom wanted to support a friend, so she went with this friend to Holt and a while she was there, she was like, 'Oh, what the heck might as well ask about my child', so she did that, but she had a lot of trouble figuring out specific details so they basically just tried to find me through like my birth date, I think, because she also hadn't seen me as a baby so she wouldn't be able to recognize any pictures. But yeah she found me and then Holt called my mom. I remember this very clearly, it was like was in the month of February 2014, I think. I remember it was a Saturday, I think, and it was like 11am and my mom comes in she's like bawling her eyes out for no reason whatsoever, but my mom was like a very, very sensitive woman so she will cry about anything. So I just looked at her, I was like, 'why are you crying?' and she basically told me that this woman named Karen who was the Danish contact for Holt had called her and basically told my mom that my real mom had like gone into the offices and she wanted me back was what my mom told me. And she was in complete shambles and then basically to initiate contact I just had to write a letter and then send it to Holt and then it has my specific case and yeah so I did, but it took me about a month to get back to them.",finding-family;post-adoption-services
00:19:23.340 ,Mya,"Because you are busier because you weren't sure how you felt about it or?"
00:19:28.230 ,Participant 003,"I don't know, I just didn't know what to say to her, to be honest. I thought it was pretty monumental, it was like one of the few  out of body, 'woah is this really happening?' experiences I've ever had in my life because you know I searched for her with no luck for six years and I thought I was going to spend the rest of my adult life looking for her.",finding-family;post-adoption-services
00:19:57.300 ,Mya,"Are you still in contact with her now?"
00:20:00.810 ,Participant 003,"I am I, I have her on Kakao talk, but we don't speak much. Basically she doesn't speak any English but her husband does, so either she has to run through a translator or he has to translate it for her and her husband is actually not that great at English either. And I speak no Korean, so I couldn't even read the letters she is sending me. So I run that through a translator every time and then I respond back to it in English, but sometimes I like I got my Korean friends to translate and then I would send it to her, but she's not very expressive and she's very cordial and formal, which is something that I personally don't really like. So she kind of she creates adistance between us, from my perspective, and it makes it a bit hard to talk to her sometimes.",family-ties;finding-family;connection;records-creation
00:21:02.430 ,Mya,"So your initial contact was made through Holt, you said that you send a letter back. At what point were you able to sort of transition to just talking to her directly?"
00:21:16.530 ,Participant 003,"There's actually a very unfortunate story... so basically, I sent that letter and then she she didn't respond back for over a year, I thought okay, she decided not to reply, but then suddenly a little bit after my 19th birthday, I think, she sent me a letter--it must have been March; I think I think I'm getting some of these dates wrong, but the essence is there--where basically she said 'sorry for not being able to write a little sooner' and then she said she'd been in the hospital with a broken arm or something, and she wasn't working at the museum anymore like she was before. And then she just talked a little bit, I guess just piggybacking on my letter because I asked to like some very basic stuff like 'oh what's your favorite fruit? Do you even like fruit? What do you like to do? Where did you go to school?' Stuff like that. And then I wrote back, actually a little bit later, but as fast as I could get the time to actually do it, and she never responded back. Which I found was really weird. So the year after I contacted Holt again I was like, 'hey, so she's not replying to me', and then they contacted her and then she wrote a letter to me and what she actually did in this letter was give me her phone number and email address. I did try to send her an email, but I got no response back then. Then, when I was 20, my Korean friend was having some kind of internship with like a university in Prague in the Czech Republic, so she texted me after I hadn't spoken to her in a couple of years, and said 'hey, I'm in Europe, do you want to hang out'. [We spent some time together] and eventually she said 'Oh, I think I can find your mom if you if you have her phone number.' So she input my mom's namea nd phone number as a contact and then she actually found her through Kakao talk and I was flabbergasted. And then she started like showing me pictures of my mom and stuff and apparently she got married. The first time I got a letter back, I also got about three or four photos I think? No I got one photo and I still have it, I still treasure it, I still have it. And I remember the first time I saw it, I actually cried because you know, there was no resemblance at all and I cry because I was like this is a sick joke, this is not my mom, like we don't look like each other at all. But then I showed it to my ex boyfriend and he, like he hit me on the shoulder and he was like you know 'you're stupid, you guys look exactly like'.I was like 'we look nothing alike' and then he--no, actually there were more photos, yeah now I remember--So he alternated between the first photo and the second photo and he was like 'okay so look, you have the same lips and the same nose and the same cheekbones, the same eyes'. And I was like, 'oh yeah, now that you say it that way, it looks more plausible to me'. But so basically I wrote out a long message in English, that I thought I wanted to send and then my friend basically translated it all to Korean and then from her phone sent a message to my mom. And we were actually very lucky within a day she responded and she was, like all emotional and she was like 'Whoa, you have my child. You know, I don't have my child, you have my child' and she was like he wanted to speak to me, and so, then you know she was overjoyed and she was so happy and so excited. I was excited and then I got kakao talk so we could talk to each other, we speak to each other sometimes, she's not really that great at responding to messages and stuff... You know, I was supposed to visit her actually last year, but the COVID.",finding-family;records-interaction;connection;agency;post-adoption-services
00:26:27.540 ,Mya,"yeah that's too bad. Do you think you'll be able to sometime in the future? Do you want to?"
00:26:34.560 ,Participant 003,"Maybe not next year, but the year after I would be willing to go to Korea because she's very... I get the feeling that actually my bio mom and my Danish mom are very similar because they both seem very scared of like traveling and stuff and like 'big bad foreign' stuff like that. Which is something I have been trying to combat and do differently in my adult life; none of my parents speak anything else other than Danish and you know, as you can see, I'm bilingual and I made it a goal in my life to study languages and travel and to know other cultures because I don't want to end up like that. Yeah so my mom has never been out of Asia, she has been to Thailand though, she was very proud to tell me that.",adopted-culture;family-ties
00:27:31.530 ,Mya,"I'm curious a little bit about the process, so when you were saying that she was able to send you letters or that you were able to send her letters.So you would send them to Holt, Holt would deliver them to her and then vice versa, so you have the actual physical letter she wrote or is a fax or a scan or something like that.",
00:27:51.420 ,Participant 003,"It's an email I got a Word document that they would translate to English... Rather poorly, but I appareciate the effort. And we would translate my letters into Korean. They would also give me like originally what she had written and then I would have my Korean friend write it out and tell me what it said. And it was more or less accurate.",post-adoption-services;family-ties
00:28:18.240 ,Mya,"yeah and so for the the photographs, those were sent digitally as well, so you you printed them out yourself."
00:28:25.140 ,Participant 003,"Oh no I didn't print any photos, although we have them on like my phone. It's actually a really good idea, I really should do that. Yeah I think I will do that that's... I will definitely do that. I never thought I never thought of that, even though it seems so simple yeah, I should do that. I will do that.",records-awareness;records-physicality
00:28:50.760 ,Mya,"You mentioned when you were talking about this when you were young so when we were in your early teens that your dad helped you get an additional copy of your adoption records? Was that, because the ones that you had weren't what you needed or just that they weren't in good condition or...?",
00:29:08.310 ,Participant 003,"No, my adoptive mom flat out refused to show me my own papers. But the thing is, where she put all her secret shit was in my room, in my closet, so I have seen them yeah. And also since I become an adult she can't really deny me the right to see my papers. And she's also very chill now, but she wasn't back when I was a teen.",records-access;records-ownership
00:29:43.290 ,Mya,"mm hmm.How did that make you feel I mean, obviously, it must have been quite frustrating that they were documents that were about you, but that she didn't want you to be able to see them or use them.",
00:29:57.990 ,Participant 003,"I had a hard time with the with my mom during my teen years also when I was younger. I would say I get why she didn't want me to. But at the same time I kind of just feel like it's my right to see them I don't care if I'm a minor, those are my papers, those are about me, you don't get to withhold information that is about me and my person, so it kind of pissed me off, but luckily I had a dad who would do anything to piss my mom off. They weren't so great after the divorce. So I've seen all of the papers, but I actually think the reason why my mom didn't want me to initially see the papers, is because, when I read them, I found out, I was the result of a rape. And that's not... The story that I had been told.",records-access;records-ownership;records-interaction;records-content;adoption-story;truth-and-accuracy
00:30:59.550 ,Participant 003,"And even though my mom have read them she still doesn't believe it; like she believes that it was just you know some young Korean kids love and then they accidentally got pregnant and then you know she couldn't teach me and then she had to give me up and like to set so sorry, it is a sad sob story, but you know just not the one my mom thinks it is.",adoption-story;records-content;truth-and-accuracy
00:31:21.780 ,Mya,"So when you first read that did you confront her about the fact that the information in there was different than what she had told you before?",
00:31:33.300 ,Participant 003,"Oh, I must say I actually don't remember, but she knows I know. But she still like I said before she still doesn't believe it.Yes, no just refuses to believe it because she's a bit.yeah I don't know what to call her. You never want to call your mom crazy but she's a bit... has a screw loose somewhere, but she's very lovable so we just let it slide.",adoption-story;truth-and-accuracy
00:32:01.650 ,Mya,"Was there information that you were expecting to find within those documents that wasn't there?"
00:32:10.440 ,Participant 003,"I guess I naively thought, when I first saw the documents, that there woudl be more information about my mom. I knew logically that you know, obviously, her name and stuff like that wouldn't be in there, but I had hoped for some kind of description of like even just how tall she was or you know what color hair or her eyes.But you know it's Korea she probably had black hair and brown eyes, I mean, but you know it counted for something. You know, even though it seemed obvious, but there was nothing. I found nothing.",records-content;records-interaction;records-desired
00:32:55.500 ,Mya,"Are there things if you had sort of been able to create, I guess, this is very hypothetical but in the context of thinking about those things that you wish you'd known.That could have been in those documents, but are there other things that you would have wanted to have information about within those records that.Potentially could have been in their proposal.",
00:33:19.980 ,Participant 003,"I would say, from a very pragmatic perspectivew, is some medical history could have been nice. But there were a bit of like... Like like I said it's how old my mom was and basically that my grandma and my mom was pregnant and then dragged her to the hospital and they chose to give me up and let her give birth, because it was like it was too late to unalive me anyway. You know, so I am the unwelcome surprise. And yeah so basically my grandpa doesn't know anything about my existence. I really to know how we can have all of that going on under your roof and he doesn't... He has no idea! Like he still has no idea. I've seen pictures of him, I know he's my grandpa, he doesn't know he has a granddaughter. And then basically it said something about what my grandma was doing. My mom went to middle school and it said something about my dad working in an office environment, and I also got to know where I am born, so I got to know i'm actually from Gangnam, which I didn't know before and was very nice to know at least. And yeah I think that was it.",family-ties;adoption-story;records-content
00:34:46.950 ,Mya,"So if you travel to Korea and to meet obviously meet your mom would you would do you think that she would introduce you to your the rest of your family as well?"
00:35:01.650 ,Participant 003,"Absolutely not, I do not think she will do that under any circumstance. And then you know I've spoken to my mom about this and yeah my very own mom was like, 'it's probably because they're going to kill her, it's probably an honor killing' and I was like 'no that's definitely not the situation'. I just don't think she's ready to do that. But her husband knows I exist and they have both been very welcoming to me. I think I think possibly at some point, you could convince my grandma to meet me but... Honestly, to them I'm just a white person that lives on the the other side of the world and they don't know anything about me and I would actually say that I am doing pretty well for myself, but they don't know that. So like to my grandma,she's very ashamed of me and it's very shameful to have me existing for her apparently. My mom is not ashamed of me, which is great, which is what you want. And she's very sweet, and she said I can definitely come meet her and I can come meet her husband, we can like talk together and do stuff we won't really be able to talk together, but I thought I could just bring my Korean friend and a megaphone or something. No, I don't think I will ever in my entire life need anyone but her and, to be honest, I wasn't looking for family, I was looking for my mom. I found my mom, she's enough.",family-ties;birth-culture;finding-family
00:36:47.190 ,Mya,"And then it's completely in the other direction, but you mentioned as a sort of practicality, having medical history would be useful... Are there instances in which you've run into having to document the fact that you don't have any medical history like when doctors are asking you questions or things like that and also have you since connecting with your mom been able to construct some sort of record for yourself?"
00:37:19.560 ,Participant 003,"So basically no, I never really had any trouble with that they would basically just ask about like my adoptive parents's medical history, and then I would relate that to them, but then I would say, 'but I am adopted so I don't think that really applies'. No, I never really run into any problems. I have asked my umma, my birth mom, and basically what my umma said was, 'We eat a lot of kimchi, we are Korean 400 years into the past, we are very healthy, we have no cancer, and we have no genetic defects and we have no history of psychiatric disabilities', so what I got from that: no cancer and lots of kimchi. That's literally just what she told me and then she also told me that we all have the same blood type, which I just I do not think that is likely, but I was not going to tell her. She seemed so happy about it.",created-facts;records-desired;records-creation
00:38:43.980 ,Mya,"Did you feel like weird about instances in which they were just like oh does give us your adoptive parents medical history?"
00:38:57.780 ,Participant 003,"No. My parents were just my parents. I mean, I just didn't feel weird about it, I was just kind of like why? Like, you have my mom beside me like you could clearly see that we weren't related, so like it didn't really make any sense. And sometimes both of both of my parents who would be there. And my dad is like very tall, and like very overweight, very blonde, so, like it's kind of like... you know we're not related, it won't matter to you, the medical history can tell you squat about me so...",created-facts;family-ties
00:39:47.700 ,Mya,"Now that you aren't always necessarily seen in association with your parents, that you're just your own person going about yourself, how often do you find yourself, if at all, disclosing to someone that you're adopted?",
00:40:15.720,Participant 003,"Oh very, very often. henever I first meet someone I will always start with I am from Denmark, and then I will usually follow up with, 'but I was adopted from South Korea'. So it makes sense to people, because you can see that people get confused. I haven't really had many nasty instances with it. It's moreso like fun and confusing you know, though not confusing for me. I switched my name, when I was 19 to what I am called now and then also to my dad's middle name. But before I had two Korean names and then two Danish names, and I just I didn't like the name and I didn't like being called what my first name was, so picked something where my parents could still call me by what they had called me and friends could still call me my nickname. So now, I have a very Danish name I am also blond so that also confuses people. So I did have an instance where we were in Zoom school, I think, two years ago, and I was the only one who showed up for like question hour with one of my professors and she already knew me because by some grace miracle of God, I was doing very well in her class. So she was like oh it's just us, why don't we just put cam on and like have a little chitchat and I was like, to be frank with you, I am smoking a cigarette and she was like oh I don't care, it's just us. So I was like Okay, and then I put my camera on and then she was like, 'Oh! didn't expect you to look like that.' And I said, 'I get that a lot it's okay.' But I had one instance I would say this summer, where I was out with my friend who has another friend who has a boyfriend was another friend that I had never met before, so this friend comes and he talks about me and we're basically comparing educational systems and I did say in the beginning, I was from Denmark when we introduced each other, but it was very loud, so I just assume he didn't hear me hear me and then he was like 'But where are you from' because we were trying to compare educational systems, and I was like i'm from Denmark he just looks at me and he goes 'no you're not' I was like 'yeah, I am' He was like 'no.' And I was like the 'Fuck yeah I am. I was adopted from South Korea to Denmark, I am Danish, is that enough for you?' and then he just got really flustered and like shut up and got all apologietic. And it really bothered me. It still low key bothers me a little bit, But, besides that no. And it's I have to tell people I'm adopted all the time. I usually don't have to tell Asians, because we can feel that I'm different, they just know instinctively that i'm just different so... You know because I have blonde hair, I look like a Scandinavian, I speak like a Scandinavian just like a Scandinavian, I act like one so...",adopted-culture;connection
00:43:54.780 ,Mya,"You mentioned about your name. Did you birth mom name you?",
00:44:08.280 ,Participant 003,"No,my foster mom did.",other-people;names;adoption-story
00:44:10.470 ,Mya,"Okay, so when you arrived in Denmark, they they decided to keep your Korean name as your first name?"
00:44:20.070 ,Participant 003,"So they decided to keep part of it because my parents are very bright... So because you know the last name is first with Korean names. So the thought my name was the first name on my papers, but that was my last name, but they didn't know that. Basically, they were going to call me Maria and--so like I said before, I have a big brother named Michael; he was 22 when I came to them, and he made a big fuss about it; he was like 'you can't call a Korean kid 'Maria' all of the other adopted Korean kids in Demark are called 'Maria' and 'Martin' you can't call her 'Maria'-- she's Asian. And they were like, 'Okay...' And he was like, 'that's such a shame, what would you call her Maria? Just keep some part of her name.' And so they decided to give me my last name as my first name. So yeah I grew up with my name being [my Korean last name] and I hated every second of it, I hate that name so much. It's very close to like another word in Danish,[and so I got teased about it]. It wasn't really something that was brought up very often either, in general I didn't have much heartache going through schooling, but I didn't really like that. But I love my new name.",names;birth-culture;adopted-culture
00:46:08.310,Mya,"What was the process like i'm changing it was it particularly difficult or was a fairly easy?",
00:46:15.060,Participant 003, "Oh no, it was easy as pie. If you want your name changed in Denmark, usually it will go through a local church office. And I had already been there twice. At that point I was in my senior year of high school and I was planning on moving to the U.S. and I was going to go with a friend and we were trying to figure out what documents we would need for the visa and such. And so she already knew me. Basically we have this kind of social secuirty portal online, so we would log in with a digital ID, which is tied to our social security. And so I would just log in with that, and click that I would like to change my name and then I could just put in what I wanted my new name to me. And then I also stripped away all of my middle names and last names and then I took my dad's middle name. And then the next day I had another name. But yeah it was pretty easy because she recognized my name and she was like, why not, and then she just approved, and it was like it was a little less than $100 to get it changed.",names;records-creation;records-access
00:48:11.340 ,Mya,"It's so interesting that it's so straightforward. I think a lot of people in the States you have to go to a court hearing. Yeah, it's pretty intense. Even if it's not in the context of someone who's adopted like if it's just someone who wants to change their last name... It's interesting.",
00:48:42.090 ,Participant 003,"Well, we also have have this thing... We do have some protected last names that you can only get if people marry into the family or you're born into it and then you can't really get them back if you choose to forfeit them.",
00:49:43.830 ,Mya,"Do you have a Danish birth certificate.",
00:49:53.760 ,Participant 003,"I believe I do. Yeah I think I do, and I also have like a baptism certificate, that, I know I do have. But yeah, that's a really good question, I actually... I must have because I have needed my birth certificate for different things and we've been able to produce one, so it must exist somewhere. I think I got a new birth certificate, maybe, when I changed my name, and I think that's what I would need to use otherwise. Otherwise it's super easym usually you would just either call up the jurisdiction or church area or you would just go into the online portal. It's nice.",records-use;records-interaction
00:50:48.030 ,Mya,"Are there any of your Korean documents that you still use or all the ones that you would like regularly need all Danish?"
00:50:59.130 ,Participant 003,"Danish yeah. I don't really know what I would use any of my Korean documents for, I mean they are very valid. I did get a passport when I go to Denmark an infant, which I think my mom to does have somewhere. It's pretty need to look at.",records-interaction;records-use
00:51:27.360 ,Mya,"You mentioned that you were pretty immersed in Danish culture and that there aren't necessarily a whole lot of Asian people around that aren't also adopted did you there were there are a lot of people that you knew when you were younger that we're also adopted or not so much."
00:51:58.530 ,Participant 003,"So basically I got adopted in a batch with four kids. One of them unfortunatley died of a lung infection (or that's the story we've been told). And then there was another boy and a girl. We actually--I don't know when we stopped doing it, but we celebrated 'gotcha day' together. I think we called it 'Korea day'. I think it was when people started getting divorced... Divorce is a big fashion in Denmark. Half of all couples get divorced. That's a real statistic, you can look it up. I reconnected with the girl some time later, actually also while I was trying to fin the  documents and stuff and I wanted someone to talk to me about it, so I don't know I think I made her go crazy because suddenly she also wanted to find her mom and stuff. So that's probably my fault oops. But the we lost touch, I think, when we were 15. I have known other people that were adopted. When I went to international boarding school, there was a Chinese girl, well a girl was adopted from China. And we talked a bit because we were both adopted and she tried to connect with me there for him, but I just she was not my type of person. She was very traumatized by her adoption. In general I haven't really gotten along with other people who have been adopted.You know I get along better with people who are not adopted, I guess.",other-adoptees;adopted-culture;birth-culture
00:55:04.500 ,Mya,Do you find that that people expect you to be like traumatized or for your adoption to be a central part of your identity in a way that it isn't?
00:55:20.970 ,Participant 003,"No. Danish people, no not at all. Also because I was adopted when I was so young, so basically like my parents are my parents. They are the first thing I remember and they will probably be the last thing I remember. So, you know, no, no one ever expects that me being adopted to be a very essential part of my personality, or whatever. And I also think it's... I don't know, for me, you just shouldn't make parts of you like that a central part of your personality, because I think you could get very, very hurt that way with your mental health. I mean there have been people who have been you know, asked me, like 'OH, do you know your mom? DO you know Korean?' But it doesn't you know, go much further than that. Sometimes, when I say that I have found my mom, they will ask me like 'Oh, how did you find her?' and then I will tell them and, and that's it.",adoption-centrality;adopted-culture;family-ties
00:57:04.740 ,Mya,"NYou were saying that you didn't necessarily grow up feeling that your adoption was central to your identity or that it was a particularly traumatic thing, but I guess if you were to think back on like your drive to find your mom... Was that, is there a particular like motivator that you feel like you can pinpoint or was it just that you wanted that connection with her?"
00:57:29.640 ,Participant 003,"I think we all just have a primal urge to know where we come from. You know it's kind of just... You know, because it's so weird for me, it's just a very strange concept for me that I have a mom somewhere on the other side of Earth she has never been to my side of earth and I have never been to her side of Earth. And you know we speak to completely different languages; she gave birth to me, but she can't speak to me and I can't speak to her. It's just... wild. It's like mind bl owing to me, it's so strange and just so, so foreign. If I think about it, I think there are two big reasons: one is the rise of KPop and the other would probably be my parents. So, I grew up in kind of like--I don't know if this is relevant for anything but I believe it is--I grew up in quite a violent home. Not against me, but there was a lot of domestic violence in in my house and just in general, my mom wasn't that great either if we are to say it lightly. So usually, when my dad was angry, it would you know, like he would go off and my mom; when my mom was angry, she would go off and my dad would leave and then she would go off at me. So when they got separated, when I was 12--which was also when I started looking--it was just it was bad. It was a bad situation and at least from my side, wer weren't able to have a proper relationship until I became an adult. And I think it's just because it didn't feel feel like I had a family, I didn't feel like they were my family, so I guess some of the drive was just to try to kind of uncomplicated the threads and I find out where I came from, because it sounded like in my papers that my mom kind of wanted to keep me if she had the opportunity to do so. And there were also a lot of years where you know I would call my mom by her first name instead of calling her mom. I still sometimes do it, but it's mostly when she just blabbers on... So the other reason would probably be the rise of KPop because suddenly it just you know kind of exploded, and I was like in this online community when I was like 10, 11... It was like a children's game, it was like called 'Supermodel' or something and they there were a lot of people that would like a couple of years older than me, my age, maybe a year so younger. And KPop got so trendy it was all we could talk about and suddenly everyone knew, you know, where Korea was and you know people wanted to speak Korean and people wanted to listen to Korean music, they wanted to learn about Korean cultulre. It was just this whole fucking explosion out of nowhere. And then I also met another girl and her mom was adopted for Korea.But she really wanted to find her grandparents and I guess I kind of like subconsciously just imitated her a little bit and that's when it started.",finding-family;family-ties;birth-culture;connection
01:01:21.000 ,Mya,"When you when sort of being Korean or Korean culture became sort of more in fashion, or like just even more well known, did you find yourself wanting to identify more with being Korean the Korean part of yourself where were you so pretty just firmly i'm Danish."
01:01:42.360 ,Participant 003,"Well, I had a couple of years whee I didn't want people to call me Danish. But that was mostly when it was really bad with my parents. And like that blew over I think. It was over by what you will call your freshman year of high school. But like, I don't... I don't know, for me, I am both. For people who know me, I am Danish. For people that don't know me, they treat me like they see me as 'other', so I am 'other' to them. I don't know... I am both, but I will always say that I am Danish first because that's what I am.",birth-culture;adopted-culture;connection
01:02:42.240 ,Mya,"You mentioned that you would get together with the other people that were adopted with you for a 'gotcha day'."
01:02:55.860 ,Participant 003,"Once a year yeah",
01:03:01.200 ,Mya,"Was that was that instigated by someone's parents or was it that you knew them, and so you wanted to get together.",
01:03:06.270 ,Participant 003,"Yeah, so I think that they just decided that it would be good and healthy for us to have the one day together every year and then we just wanted to celebrate that we were their kids, I guess. It ran smoothly for some time and then like I said, some of the relationships got complicated and then people just started getting into fights and we decided let's know see eachother anymore. I think like I followed the girl on instagram, she follows me, we're friends on Facebook, but we don't really speak to eachother. We have taken very different life paths. The boy, we haven't spoken to him in over 10 years, I guess. I tried reaching out but he's had no, no interest in having contact with either of us, and I think that's okay. I think it's kind of wild to see--we kind of, in a way, came from the same face grew up together, but look at how different we are now.", other-adoptees
01:05:14.820 ,Mya,"Do you ever like make posts on social media or right or do anything that were you sort of either like public do personally or discipline of private sphere talk about your adoption?",
01:05:33.900 ,Participant 003,"Not on like social media no I never heard on that, like. I had made some posts in that same group where you found me, I think, and I have also I have responded so some posts sometime, but other than that I don't really talk about by adoption is not really something people asked about it's not really something I think to talk about.",other-adoptees;adoption-media;adoption-centrality
