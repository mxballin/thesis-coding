00:00:06.240 ,Mya,alrighty so we can start.,
00:00:20.700 ,Participant 001,um no no preference.,
00:00:27.630 ,Mya,"let's just start with the reading, then I don't know how much you were able to or wanted to look for you.",
00:00:34.500 ,Participant 001,"yeah I did look through, and I think.",
00:00:46.140 ,Mya,yeah no problem.,
00:00:59.100 ,Participant 001,interesting.,
00:01:12.900 ,Mya,"Technically, yes.",
00:01:14.760 ,Participant 001,Okay yeah.,
00:01:17.040 ,Mya,A little bit our I guess experimental and it's forum but yes.,
00:01:20.520 ,Participant 001,yeah or is all of this more like current adoptee stuff.,
00:01:25.950 ,Mya,"yeah it is it's sort of an interesting thing I don't know how often or, if at all, you engage or seek out or consume like adoption related media, but a lot of times I found it, it tends to focus or be produced more concerning Korean and options, rather than Chinese.",
00:02:02.250 ,Participant 001,"yeah, that is true, I did not know very much about the whole Korean culture or Korean adoptee stuff until like the Facebook group.",
...,,,
00:02:52.590 ,Mya,"i'm not expecting you to have like an essay prepared or anything.Like that I guess it was more just sort of curious about if there was anything that you.found to be sort of similar to your experience or that you found was contrary to like how you feel about your experience.And if there, I guess, like thinking about the fact that there isn't sort of a similar documentary culture.around like producing things in relation to Chinese adoptees whether or not this like type of material still resonates with you, or if it's just kind of two different to to really feel like something you can.really do.",
00:03:40.200 ,Participant 001,"I did notice with the first poem the orphan considers the hand of God.not actually kind of reminded me of a poem actually read in one of my English lit classes, which God I don't remember the name of that i'll try to look it up and. They're like pretty different, but this one, I was surprised that I like so much emphasis on I guess ancestors and names. Most of the other angsty adoptee stuff from Chinese adoptees I tend to find have more to do with like the immediate parents, rather than past ancestors.and also the whole gender thing because one child policy and whatnot in China.yeah, I guess, I never really realized that wasn't as big of a factor and other countries.",asian-diaspora;other-adoptees;adoptedness-centrality
00:04:54.750 ,Participant 001,"Yeah it was a good poem oh yeah. That one definitely had more to do with acknowledging like the reasons for abandonment. Mm hmm which I didn't really find to what I guess for the Korean stuff doesn't really talk as much about it. But yeah. Definitely interesting to read. Don't totally understand a whole bunch of it, though. I don't really know too much about Korean culture mm hmm.What does the centaur have to do with anything.",
00:05:36.360 ,Mya,"Honestly, no idea.There are certain parts that I find to be like particularly interesting or useful in terms of how like I think about. The role of records and there are other things where it's a little too little to poetry for me.",
00:06:02.910 ,Participant 001,"yeah I feel like maybe two years ago I probably would have figured something out more but no, no longer in school so.",
00:06:20.340 ,Mya,"Have you watched any of like the recent documentaries that have been coming out or the movies, or anything.",
00:06:28.470 ,Participant 001,"No, I tend to find in that stuff same kind of depressing yeah I usually avoid depressing media usually. I've also kind of resigned myself to the whole thing about not really being able to find out more anyways so Why torture myself with. yeah other people's stories so i'm not very caught up mostly just what comes up in the whole Facebook group so yeah no.",adoptedness-centrality;other-adoptees;information-limits; adoption-media
00:07:03.030 ,Mya,"um is that a reluctant resignation, or just kind of.",
00:07:14.250 ,Participant 001,"Oh.kind of.little bit of that like.Since I know it's not going to go anywhere I don't have much interest, but also that type of documentary style things isn't really my general TV or movie and trust anyways I kind of prefer something more lighthearted in comedy or action. In general I don't really see the point of going any further into it, I guess, I was kind of surprised by how much paperwork, there was in the cartoon comic. yeah but yeah I did not realize, there were so much paperwork in some people's cases.", other-adoptees;information-limits;records-awareness; adoption-media
00:08:04.530 ,Mya,"In general, like thinking about.That but also thinking about like your own paperwork that you both haven't haven't seen.um who do you think all that paperwork is is really.made for, and do you think that that's who, it should be made for.",
00:08:29.280 ,Participant 001,"All the paperwork involved in the adoption process? My understanding is that it's mainly just a legal paper trail, to make sure that everything's done legally. Because, you know, transferring citizenship and family rights and whatnot is a pain in the ass, but it is kind of necessary like to have records and copies of that.Also, I think it does have a lot to do with the country's reputation and like kind of control our power over their citizens too. So I mean it makes sense to me, although it'd be nice if they kind of also kept something for the adoptees if they want to ever come back later, but I don't think they really do. Yeah I think in that line of business, they usually don't expect that's going to come up again later. Because I mean everyone goes into the whole adoption thing with different ideas about what they think is going to happen or how they think it's going to affect everyone else so yeah. I mean to me it seems, it makes sense, but it's also kind of like it'd be nice if they thought, a little bit more about the future rather than just making sure everything's fine on paper.", records-use;records-desired;agency;legality;care
00:10:02.610 ,Mya,"What what kind of.Things would you have hoped that they would have had for you or that would be created to enable you to do X, Y or Z.",
00:10:15.810 ,Participant 001,"For nongovernment papers, it would be nice if they like kept a record of first meetings or general meetings or interviews they ever hold with the.adoptive parents and the adoptees because I feel like that should be interesting to go over. Yeah it's usually kind of that you just get your parents account on what the first meeting was like. But that's kind of pretty biased. And I mean it's never going to be possible for me, but because I'm pretty sure all that was never recorded but yeah it'd be nice to kind of actually have a more objective record of that like what it's like and.Even there, I don't know two people trying to adopt have like a personal profile.That goes into the system, or is it.", records-desired;information-limits;adoption-story; truthfulness-and-accuracy
00:11:21.270 ,Mya,"I don't know officially, I think. At least for me, I think my mom did have to have some amount of like home visits, so I assume there must be some case file of notes relating to like whoever did those visits and talk to her because yeah but.",
00:11:45.930 ,Participant 001,"I feel like it'd be cool if there was like an actual character profile, plus the parents would have to write like an application essay mm hmm like talking about what type of people they are why they're going down this route, what they're expecting or hoping for that'd be really cool. Yeah, especially since I know my parents were like completely different people back then and they changed a lot over the years, and if you've like lived with them the whole time, you don't really notice the changes but that'd be cool to have like snapshot moment of that.",records-desired;adoption-story
00:12:21.750 ,Mya,that's really interesting I like that idea.,
00:12:24.210 ,Participant 001,Yeah or even just like a baby profile of the baby adopt a other than like just general stats on height weight and whatnot. I don't really know how to describe babies are kind of all the same to me but.,records-desired;adoption-story
00:12:43.650 ,Mya,"This positions, though right. At least like hearing people talk about. Their kids they're like Oh, you were a happy baby right there like you always cry or something like.",
00:12:57.180 ,Participant 001,"Oh yeah my parents did tell me that when they first met me one of the things I drew them towards me was how I have laughed as a baby. Yeah and then they would try to recreate that laugh, and it would just make me cringe on the inside. Apparently I had a very high pitched giggle laugh that people liked. Oh yeah every cool there was, like the whole adoptee profile and how I don't know, whoever makes a profile with describe them. I'm not, at least for China, I don't know if they actually tried to match the kid with the parents or if it's completely random.",adoption-story;records-content;records-desired
00:13:40.230 ,Participant 001,"Cuz I had heard that in most cases that the parents are just like assigned a kid and they don't really get a say in anything just kind of like Well, this is the one we've got for you, I don't really know if they put any thought into matching them or not.Since we don't really know how you would match your baby to family again oh baby seeing the same to me.",logistics;other-adoptees;
00:14:07.080 ,Mya,Do you do you think your your perception of that process or like wanting to imagine that there would be some matching is related to the fact that you were slightly older?,
00:14:30.270 ,Participant 001,"I don't think so, I know that my mom was in an in kind of a unique position where she actually was allowed to choose. Because, for one thing, she could pull a lot of strengths and she worked in that she knew a lot of people in the industry and had like worked there briefly and I think, or something about my case that also made it so that she could choose, I think it was all medical heart murmur thing which eventually went away, but for short moment did classify me as special needs or something.Okay, thank not 100% sure could attempt that but.yeah i'm mostly interested because I did see a lot of other adoptees and the whole cult common thing in China.who went to.Other families that were very different than mine and I kind of... Okay, first of all I'm kind of atheist agnostic at the moment, but I do pretty much, thank God, every day, I never went to those families, because they were like super strict evangelical missionary types, which I would not be able to just to survive and now.yeah but.Their kids seem totally happy with them right now so.it's really does bring up the whole nature versus nurture thing I wonder if I went to a different family if I would actually be happy there or if I would still turn out kind of like who I am today and up completely rejecting them eventually. But strangely enough, most of the adoptees I knew back then were like hundred percent happy with their families which I didn't realize there was so much.mismatching or resentment and a lot of other adoptive families. Until I came to the whole adoptee group, yeah that was definitely something surprising to me.",adoption-story;other-adoptees;family-ties
00:16:44.160 ,Mya,Oh no you're all good. One of the things that was actually in the sort of graphic novel section that I sent you was that something that I thought was really interesting. Was that so in the context of the person who was writing the books attempts to access her records of adoption and.It was required by the adoption agency that she had expressed permission to from her mother her birth mother to be able to either records andadoption.,
00:17:32.760 ,Participant 001,For yeah privacy thing.,
00:17:34.920 ,Mya,"yeah with the idea that they belonged to her mom rather than to her so it's like thinking about again, since this is hypothetical like in the context of those documents of like.An a potential adopt drivers like profile or things like that.Would you.Your sort of.assumption or again in this hypothetical what would be that someone would be able to have access to those like an adoptee.",
00:18:09.480 ,Participant 001,"yeah.Like mixed feelings about that to some extent, I do think the birth family should get some degree of privacy. But I also do think adoptees are kind of entitled to a certain amount of information. But also considering like how. Like i've also read like a lot of different stories about domestic adopt days in the US so there's like a whole range of messed up situations out there.",records-ownership;other-adoptees;agency
00:18:45.840 ,Mya,yeah.,
00:18:46.350 ,Participant 001,"So I think like personal information and contact information should definitely need permission from the birth family, but I think like general information surrounding the adoption should be allowed to the adoptee. Also, that also just reminds me it would have been cool if, like you know the Chinese birth families had like some sort of application paperwork, or just general paperwork as well, instead of you know just.disappearing.",records-ownership;other-adoptees;agency;records-content;records-desired
00:19:28.350 ,Mya,"yeah yeah And what about the sort of adoptive side, so you were mentioning that you would have been interested in knowing a little bit more about the mindset that your.adoptive parents had been in sort of when they were considering where you know applying or going through the process of adopting you.In those cases, should that information also word that information also always be open or.",
00:20:00.930 ,Participant 001,"I think that information should be open, but they could probably like sensor out any identifying or like actually if they're your adopted adoptive parents, the already another identities.yeah that type of information I think should be allowed, since that's already being submitted for application it's not like exactly personal private anyway, since it goes through a lot of hands and it very much affects the.adoptees life in perspective, and I think we are kind of owed an explanation of how we got somewhere. Like anything in terms of explanations I think should be like allowed but maybe just the more... #TODO Maybe, just like the really private--What do you call it? yeah identifying information--on the birth parents side shouldn't be allowed to be censored, you know okay so there's no doubt out there who's like got a really bad grudge.explanation was it should always be out.",records-ownership;records-content;agency
00:21:19.350 ,Mya,"Again sort of in this hypothetical concept. When would or when should that be made available? Like, I think one of the things that I find interesting is that a lot of times on the Korean side you'll see adoptees try sooner than when they're 18 to find information and there'll be denied because they're not old enough they're not an adult. Is there ever a situation or would you imagine that record should have a sort of sealed until date or again if there's if if that's information about like your context your life should that always be available to you?",
00:22:08.850 ,Participant 001,"I think, since it's pretty emotionally sensitive things with your adoptive parents permission, you should be allowed to access it whenever since they'll be there to like support you if it causes like a whole emotional breakthrough or breakdown, or whatever. But like without any adult supervision or support, I would say it probably would be best to wait till like you're at least 15. Because it's not like drinking or anything, it's not going to like physically harm you, so I don't really see why it has to like be legally 18 or 21, but I feel like 15 would probably be a good emotional maturity age for someone to be able to handle it on their own or sort of on their own, but like also, have enough awareness of their situation to actually put it into the right context, because if you try to take in that information like without the right context, it can it would probably cause some damage to you mentally or emotionally or cause some very wrong conclusions to be drawn. But like if the adoptive parents give permission, I think it should be allowed anytime since they can do the explaining and context setting.",agency;records-ownership;records-interaction
00:23:35.820 ,Mya,We sort of talked last week about the fact that that your mom.is the one who like currently holds all of the records that you are. #TODO,
00:23:54.780 ,Participant 001,"Honestly don't really know we don't really talk about the records themselves that much, and I certainly hope she has copies.But then again I wouldn't be surprised if they've been lost throughout our many, many moves because she doesn't she doesn't really have a permanent home base, so I would be surprised if she actually carries i'm everywhere, she goes, but I think she has access to that stuff at least.Or how to find that.", records-access;records-ownership
00:24:34.920 ,Mya,"At what point, or is there ever a point where.it's an adoptee or I guess in your case you obviously.should become like the primary holder, the primary person to know how to access that information or is it sort of do you see it as your mom's responsibility to sort of be the one to either hold on to it or to know how to access it.",
00:25:13.980 ,Participant 001,"It's complicated since everyone's situation is different. I feel like it would be simplest for the Guardian to hold on to it until the adoptee like.takes initiative and.wants to take over those papers, but at the same time that kind of causes its own problems with each different person.So they're like a lot of adoptees that just have no interest at all and that stuff so I don't think it should be automatically transferred over because.I think, at least from my situation I feel like it's kind of.Equally.Important to both of us.Because, for one thing, it like affects.My whole life and being.But on the other hand, she also did like.Over seven years on all of that, and it kind of affects her tues and she's my mom.yeah no yeah I don't think there's really a simple answer on who would should go to at a certain age.yeah maybe like equal access but that's kind of hard to implement, especially since some people don't have like greatest relationships with their adoptive parents so.I think the adoptive should definitely be allowed to take over it, if they want to.yeah.Probably by 18 now.", records-ownership; agency
00:26:51.600 ,Mya,"yeah is there ever an instance where you see yourself wanting to have that sort of primary control or I know you mentioned that you feel like you both have sort of an equal, but maybe slightly different attachment to to those stock.",
00:27:09.450 ,Participant 001,"I personally wouldn't want to be in charge of documents, because, like along with her i've moved a lot too and i'm still not really in a very permanent situation yet and I don't really feel comfortable keeping so many important documents or information on me.Yet, so I feel safer if she's.Hopefully, has it.But like if I ever get in a situation where I actually like and know i'm going to stick around somewhere for like years and years, I think it would be nice for me to keep it.", records-ownership; agency
00:27:53.220 ,Mya,"Does the fact that you don't entirely know if she has them or just if she can, or if it's just that she has the knowledge does that make you uncomfortable at all.",
00:28:12.390 ,Participant 001,"It does make me a little slightly worried. Only slightly though cuz for the most part, I don't really care that much for the whole legality aspect of it, and I know she knows the story and she's never really lied to me before, so I kind of completely trust her whenever she ever recounts anything or tells me about the whole process because she's always been super honest. I think the only lie she's ever told me was about the tooth mouse, which I had instead. of the tooth fairy. She had a French boyfriend at the time, and apparently and France, they have tooth mice.", records-ownership; records-absence; records-use
00:29:03.720 ,Mya,"So for you, you would say that the records represent more or are important because of the story, they tell rather than specifically like their legal power.",
00:29:16.740 ,Participant 001,"Yeah it's I kind of just want to be able to know the facts, and I know the way my mom tells it's usually a little bit more biased on her end, but I would like to know about the more objective details. Like the only reason why I'd be slightly worried is if she ever forgets it and I sure as hell know that I'm already forgetting parts of it as my memory success. Yeah and also if it's on paper it's kind of easier to like be able to go back to it, if you do forget details but um yeah.",records-meaning; records-use;records-content;truthfulness-and-accuracy
00:29:58.110 ,Mya,"Have you ever.Creative like your own documents related to your adoption, have you ever like wanted to write something down or to sort of have a written account in the the sort of event that potentially something gets forgotten. Or did you ever.participate in any type of.Like adoption programming, where you had to do that as a kid.",
00:30:27.900 ,Participant 001,"I don't think so i'm like the most i've ever done was probably when I went through a very angsty poetry phase. Yeah i've written like two or three poems about in my adoption or like feeling surrounding that, although that was kind of a very small part of my whole angsty phase. Yeah like 40 others about other things, then I got distracted with other stuff.",
00:31:09.690 ,Participant 001,"I don't think I really participated in anything in adoption-centric things. um yeah I never really had very much interest in it, when I was younger cuz when I was in China, like it just happened to be that a good chunk of my friends were also adoptees, but I also have a good chunk that weren't.And it just was kind of what I grew up with, and then, since I moved a lot things changed, and I just kind of accepted the change and never really looked back much.i'm not really sure if I would have wanted to, though I have an adopted um I have a cousin on my dad's side who.is adopted from Thailand and his mom who is my dad's cousin she still works for holt so she's a lot more involved with the whole adoptee stuff and I know that he regularly goes to like adoptee hold camps.Which i've heard about, and apparently he has a lot of fun with it, so I don't know, maybe it would have been interesting and I didn't really like summer camps that much so maybe. Hard to say, but I don't really think I had very much interest in actually writing it down. You feel like just knowing it is enough.", adoptedness-centrality; ambiguity-and-ambivalence;other-adoptees
00:32:32.280 ,Mya,"You mentioned that sort of the way that your mom tells the story is obviously sort of her skew or her take on on the experience and that may be the records.Either do or could, if there had been other documentation would be slightly more objective or I guess accurate to not just her experience. How important is the idea of a document having a more objective take on something to to you in this context and what sort of I guess objectivity do you imagine them having?",
00:33:19.350 ,Participant 001,"I guess it's not really that important to me, I am just more really curious about it because my mom never really tells me about anything that I wasn't personally involved in, so I don't actually know much about the process one went through or about any of like the maybe more negative sides of it. She always paints it as one of those like happy first meet things and then it took so long to finally happen. She did say that some points they honestly didn't... They were honestly very worried that it wouldn't happen, but that was usually glossed over really quickly. Since she's more on the more emotional side, I think she kind of tries to avoid talking about like the more the harder aspects and the non happy stuff, so it's more just my own personal curiosity of what else there is to story. But I kind of know it's not really going to affect me that much if I either know it or don't know it. I feel like the objective stuff would probably just be knowing more about the environment, I used to be in or even just like statistics about the other kids know environment too. Like where they ended up. Or how many people went through there or just kind of those facts type things.",adoption-story; truth-and-accuracy;records-accuracy;records-content;conversation-barriers;ambivalence;other-adoptees

00:35:20.850 ,Participant 001,Considering how my first 'official' orphanage was kind of illegal and unofficial I don't think they kept actual statistics.,
00:35:30.540 ,Mya, Yeah so it's more of a hypothetical than it is an actual possibility.,
00:35:36.570 ,Participant 001,"yeah I did stumble across like a blog post that the lady who ran the House had she didn't have very much information on the particular house that I was at, but I did read about like posts from other houses that she had set up later on that actually were official and legal. [The author] did give a little bit background details on like the first place she set up in Guangzhou. She didn't have enough money to actually pay the government fees for it to like be considered a real orphanage, which is why they were a bit more short handed and kind of under the table sort of and didn't really have the same amount of support or funds but that you know she's still like one of those missionary Christian type so nothing's going to stop her from doing what she thinks is right. I mean part of me is like Oh well, that's nice but also like I mean skirting around the roles isn't really going to help very much.yeah if anything that just complicates things for the people you're trying to help.But yeah it all worked out though being made things more complicated, but I guess it all worked out.yeah it'd be nice if I could like learn a little bit more about that, but then again that's just pure curiosity doesn't really actually matter too much whether or not it comes up I don't have that much.Energy or drive to do much of a deep dive into that stuff myself.yeah.", white-saviourism;adoption-story;other-people;other-adoptees;records-access;ambivalence

00:37:50.430 ,Participant 001,"I usually try to look at that and a more objective or cold angle because I know how emotionally charged that subject is. Particularly for adoptees so I know that it's pretty easy to think that, yes, we should be allowed all of that information because, yes, it affects our life is very much a big part of us, and we should know that but also on the other hand, again I like read a lot of stories about like domestic adoption and reasons for why things are closed.or like what happens once that people have like found their families or like when things go South when that happens so.",agency;other-adoptees;ambivalence
00:38:31.710 ,Mya,yeah.,
00:38:31.980 ,Participant 001,"I do think, to some degree, there does need to be a protective layer for both parties. Again, I think maybe less identifying stuff should be definitely open because there really is no harm to it, but then I do think that the bio family should also be allowed a certain degree of anonymity sort of. But also it's kind of a dick move on their on their part, but that kind of more as to go with their character, rather than like legal rights.",agency;records-content;records-access
00:39:22.050 ,Mya,"Considering the fact that there either is or isn't be documentation and sometimes there is sometimes there is and then that can have an emotional impact like, as you mentioned, like either someone who does find a lot of information can be very emotionally impacted or someone who has no ability to find out anything can also feel strongly and one way or another, is there an onus upon the organizations that that deal with these types of relationships and documenting these relationships, for purposes of legality to consider the sort of more emotional angle of it.",
00:40:16.950 ,Participant 001,"I personally don't think so. I feel the whole adoption company update companies and legal companies and whatnot is like purely business, so I don't really take it personally if they're not personally invested because again it's basically just a transaction a business a service if anything I would put more of the responsibility or blame on the biological family because they're the ones that are kind of starting the whole thing. So yeah yeah I am I might be a little bit more detached most adoptees yeah yeah at least that's how I think about it.",adoption-industry;other-people;records-onus;post-adoption-services
00:41:11.430 ,Participant 001,"I mean, in the end they're adoption agencies are just a service that people use, which, if they do it would be nice or better if they did, like take into account the future emotional repercussions, I think it'd be better for their business, but again it's not just a business.",adoption-industr;post-adoption-services;other-people
00:41:46.470 ,Mya,"From your perspective, given that your your mom was involved with Holt, do you find that your experience of her sort of emotional response to your adoption is different than like other accounts that you've read or the different than if she had been like entirely separate from that industry.",
00:42:14.010 ,Participant 001,"I think so because I think she, thankfully, is more aware of what goes on like throughout the whole process so she's more aware of how much work it takes for everything to actually like work out legally. She has also met a lot of adoptees and their families and has also knows like how some of them have ended well I think most of the ones, she knows, are like happy endings. So she is more aware of the emotional aspect of the whole process and how difficult it how difficult the journey is from the start to the end and how some cases just sometimes never work out and all that so I think she was like a lot more emotionally invested in the process than most adoptive parents would have been at the start because she went into it like already knowing she wanted to adopt me it wasn't because she just wanted a kid. She had told me before that she had never planned on having kids.",other-adoptees;adoption-industry;adoption-story
00:43:30.480 ,Mya, Really? interesting.,
00:43:31.410 ,Participant 001,Yeah so her motivations were quite a bit different yeah.,
00:43:36.330 ,Mya,"Do you think that her sort of perspective in in being an adoptive parent, working in in that industry is beneficial to that process, or does it not matter who who the people working at some are like holes are and they're either relationship or non relationship to that option and adoptees.",
00:44:01.290 ,Participant 001,"And I think was beneficial because she was already pretty well informed. She also had a lot more resources to is like she did actually have to pull a lot of strings and get quite a few favors to get the whole thing whole adoption process put through.Like smoothly sort of, and I have found her with quite a few parenting books that were specifically about adoptees.Before like on our bookshelf.She also did keep a good stock of adoptee children's books for me and he was very good at explaining the whole thing like when I was younger and.yeah I think she was just all around more prepared.yeah more prepared, in a sense, and informed.yeah all right, she was still a young parents, so there were some aspects, she wasn't prepared for it, but that was more just general parenting not really adoption.",adoption-conversations;adoption-media
00:45:11.790 ,Mya,"Did you read those books, a lot when you were a kid.",
00:45:15.750 ,Participant 001,"There were like picture children's books, so I think they were usually just read to me.I think so yeah. I think my mom was the one that probably read them to me more often. Cuz a few memories that I have, like again my memory sucks, but the few memories, that I do have in China, when I was like just with my dad because I have no memories of them being together they got divorced in the middle of the whole thing, he was in his like very religious phase there. His version of bedtime stories were Bible verses and Bible stories .But my mom was better; she actually like read me like actual children's books. I think she definitely tried to make sure that whole adoption theme was always like out in the open, for me. I don't think my dad considered it very much because he's kind of the more... I guess he's a little more detached than my mom like he doesn't talk about as much. Very stereotypical American male.",adoption-media;adoption-conversations;conversation-barriers
00:46:55.770 ,Mya,"The other part of the interview is, if you have any records that you either imaginary or not that you would like to sort of talk about or like to share. I know that you mentioned you sort of written some stuff down.",
00:47:27.240 ,Participant 001,"Oh yeah so I don't actually have any records with me so they're probably more like hypothetical records I guess. Like one of the things I've always wanted was a birth certificate.yeah because that's just one of those things that most people have that never changes you never have to get updated or like extended.Because things like passports, you always have to get that extended and just get a new one, you don't really keep the original copy unless you want to for sentimental reasons.yeah actually I don't know where my original is right now feel like I kept it I just don't know if I got lost in the moves or, if I have it somewhere.",records-desired;logistics
00:48:12.540 ,Participant 001,"I should probably figure that out someday. But man birth certificates like just one of those things that well that's not really I feel like a lot of people do lose theirs, but it's supposed to stay with you, your whole life. yeah yeah that'd be cool because that's got like your whole actual birth date and... actually I don't really know how much information goes on those. Is it a birthday and weights and time and place?",records-desired;records-content
00:48:44.160 ,Mya,"I think, so I also do not know.",
00:48:50.640 ,Participant 001,"yeah also I just make like a lot of legal application so much easier to. Because a lot of processes kind of require that because, again, it's like the one objective thing that stays with someone their whole life.",truthfulness-and-accuracy;records-desired;records-content
00:49:07.260 ,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:49:09.780 ,Participant 001,"I don't know why, but I feel like there's a footprint on a birth certificate.",records-content
00:49:13.920 ,Mya,"soda why, like in my mind yeah like in my mind like if if you build a birth certificate, it has a footprint on it right like.",
00:49:23.070 ,Participant 001,I think. I also don't know if I've ever seen anyone's birth certificate before. Yeah yeah i've never really needed to yeah and if it's not your own it's not really relevant.,records-content;other-people
00:49:36.720 ,Mya,yeah perhaps not.,
00:49:38.610 ,Participant 001,yeah it's kind of weird to ask your friends to see that. Well it'd be cool because I don't actually know very much about the circumstances of my birth. I've got no clue if I happened involves actually in a hospital or that was like an alleyway or a back of a taxi cab., records-content;records-absence;information-limits;ambiguity;records-desired
00:50:00.060 ,Mya,Is that a record that you would want of your your actual literal birth?,
00:50:07.710 ,Participant 001,"yeah my be nice.yeah but unfortunately that's just doesn't really work out in China.yeah you got it because I have a feeling that also includes your parents information to.I believe so, yes yeah usually yeah i'm pretty sure they're supposed to record the biological parents or is it just legal guardians.",information-limits;records-absence;records-desired;records-content
00:50:37.230 ,Mya,No clue.,
00:50:41.100 ,Participant 001,"I think it's actually I think it's probably legal guardians, because the whole surrogates and whatnot and donors yeah. Okay, well, I would like a birth certificate of my actual birth. Yeah and ideally birth family.But also like if that weren't possible, I would also be happy with just my adoptive family on it too.yeah cuz my parents have sometimes worried about having to prove their relationship to me.",records-content;logistics;records-absence;family-ties
00:51:17.340 ,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:51:18.030 ,Participant 001,"Because most people don't really figure that out or her not really all that believing at first. Actually, I think Asian adoptees have become a bit more common now, so people don't question it when you just say you're adopted. Yeah or at least just different race adoptees are more common now, in this day and age, but probably like back in the older times it probably would have been less common and probably questioned more. Yeah that'd be cool to have. Yeah i'm honestly, just like really curious about like where exactly I was born. Well, and, if not a birth certificate, maybe like an abandonment certificate, too. That'd be cool, like when and where. Which I feel like would be more reasonable or realistic although I don't think that actually exists for me, but maybe for other I think other adoptees is there, probably are like actual documentation to that. There's usually there's like police reports right?",family-ties;records-content;information-limits;records-absence;ambiguity;other-adoptees;records-desired
00:52:53.160 ,Mya,"I would assume so. Like in your mind. would that be the same thing, though or would you want to see a document more akin to a birth certificate. Rather than it just being a police report... like does the connotation of it being a police report versus a certificate that's produced for the purposes of an adoptee make a difference, or not so much.",
00:53:22.110 ,Participant 001,"I mean, I would think there would be different information on it, but I would be happy with either. Yeah I feel like an abandonment certificate would be more like a birth certificate with probably bare minimum information but also like the facts are there whereas like a police report would have more situational descriptions. I would think, at least, I also have never seen a real police report, thank God. But the TV shows make it seem like they write stuff down, so I feel like that would actually be probably more useful to have because they would also like put down anything that would have been in a certificate, as well the time place and then more details about the circumstances probably or, like other people that might be involved, like who found me and whatnot because right now I don't know where exactly I was left I just that it was a retirement home.",records-creation;records-content;other-people;adoption-story
00:54:29.460 ,Participant 001,"And I don't know if my mom board members, the exact place. And I don't really want to ask her because I don't know what I would do with that information, it's not like I go visit.",ambivalence;adoption-story
00:54:41.400 ,Participant 001,And retirement homes are kind of a weird place to visit if you don't have anyone there.,
00:54:49.290 ,Mya,"Emotionally would, if you were to in this ideal world, have the option of both. Would you have, do you think you would have an attachment to one over the other?",
00:55:09.810 ,Participant 001,"I think i'd be more attached to the certificate, because I feel more official. Yeah because the police report would just feel circumstantial.",records-connection
00:55:19.860 ,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:55:20.280 ,Participant 001,"But a certificate would feel like a legitimate piece of document that you can use and applications for stuff or just like for building your or edges, like a record that most normal people would have. Because people don't really like keep... I don't think people keep police reports of anything they're involved in. But and in an ideal world, an abandonment certificate would also like include th birth parents and reason for abandonment I would think. At least that's the ideal one, the more realistic scenario would be that there had been none of that information, it would just be like date, time, place, and baby info. Either way,though I would definitely probably gravitate more towards a certificate yeah because that would be the closest thing to a birth certificate.",records-use;records-meaning;records-content
00:56:30.540 ,Mya,Does does the fact that you don't have anything similar make you feel a certain way?,
00:56:45.810 ,Participant 001,"i'm a.little bit sad.I have a feeling you get when you kind of miss something.Man, I do not remember the names of emotions.My closest one is.yeah yeah.Because it's kind of something that.you realize you don't really have but other people take for granted.And then I just kind of spins into a whole what if, or why type of questioning or line of thinking which just gets kind of depressing sometimes so and.",records-meaning;records-absence
00:57:38.280 ,Mya,Is the legality of the of this hypothetical document also something that that would be important to you.,
00:57:47.850 ,Participant 001,yeah.,
00:57:48.720 ,Mya,You go purpose or power.,
00:57:52.050 ,Participant 001,"yeah I feel like if it's legal it's more permanent.Especially with my whole life being nothing but changes.yeah I kind of appreciate anything that's permanent or that.is recognized as.A document that doesn't need to be updated, but is accepted.yeah.cuz I gotta say right now, my main identifying document is my passport and that's gotta be updated and it's such a pain in the ass.yeah and i've got like other ID cards, but those usually expire, and then have to update those and, like, I just want one thing that doesn't expire.",legality;records-use
00:58:55.380 ,Mya,"What about this hypothetical document is different? Or what what is it about that that you would want it, in comparison to I guess the documents that your mom had to use when you were crossing the border to Canada.",
00:59:18.330 ,Participant 001,"Well, probably because that starts earlier in my life, so it feels like it's.It feels more permanent there earlier, it relates to in my life I guess. On paper my mom didn't meet me until I was seven.",records-desired;records-meaning;records-absence
00:59:38.850 ,Mya,mm hmm.,
00:59:39.630 ,Participant 001,"Like for legal purposes it would be nice to have like any information about me before then. Yeah because everything before I was legally adopted and given like actual legal status anywhere it was all just verbal. Okay yeah. And again my memory sucks, yeah I prefer things on paper.",records-desired;records-use;records-absence
01:00:14.340 ,Mya,"All right, no, no photographs or anything of you...",
01:00:18.510 ,Participant 001,"Oh no, there's pictures my parents had but just like no legal--at least, not that I know of--no legal actual documentation. I think yeah.",
01:00:32.310 ,Mya,Do you.Ever look at photographs from before that time is there an album somewhere or.,
01:00:46.050 ,Participant 001,"yeah actually, that is a good question i'm pretty sure there used to be photo album but I don't know my mom still has that or she lost it.",ambiguity
01:00:55.140 ,Mya,yeah.,
01:00:55.980 ,Participant 001,"I haven't been to her place and so long, she keeps moving. When we lived in the US, I'm pretty sure she did actually have a photo album like an actual album of physical photos. Back when we were in China, before I was adopted, even after too. Actually yeah but like of when I was like a baby through toddlerhood through general childhood, and I mean I was barely recognizable because back then I wore pink for some reason.",ambiguity;records-content
01:01:35.880 ,Participant 001,But yeah.That was kind of nice to be able to to go through it yeah., records-interaction
01:01:42.720 ,Mya,"Did you look at it often, do you remember?",
01:01:45.960 ,Participant 001,"I don't think I looked at it very often, but maybe like.once a year, just to like refresh my memories about it. yeah just like kind of for an historic reasons look through it, because I don't really have many actual memories of most of those photos because I was quite young. yeah being able to see it as like a bit of a timeline does kind of help me sort of keep track of what happened.",records-interaction;records-use;adoption-story
01:02:20.490 ,Mya,yeah.,
01:02:21.120 ,Participant 001,"Because i'm a very out of sight out of mind person so after we moved away from China, I didn't really keep up much and it just felt like a closed chapter in my life that I would never go back to. It's kind of nice [to be able to] look back on it.",records-interaction;records-use;connection
01:02:38.640 ,Mya,Because you don't have.Like legal documentation of from when before you were seven do you do you feel like those photos act as an adequate substitute.,
01:03:00.150 ,Participant 001,"Really, I feel like the photos are purely sentimental. And it's I mean, most of them are just pictures and there's not really very much description, so I can only see it as a snapshot and they're always happy moments too so it's not all that accurate about like what else happened, or what exactly was going on at that time. But I mean still nice to have. I should figure out how to visit my mom one of these days so maybe you can go through it again, it's been so long. Actually, I think it's been probably more than eight years since I've seen them because I don't know if she took it with her to Hong Kong when we moved there, or if she kept it in storage.",records-meaning;records-interaction;records-use;truth-and-accuracy
01:04:11.370 ,Mya,"Do you find or feel like there is a different value in a physical document versus a digital copy, I know you mentioned that you sort of have a really grainy copy of your records.",
01:04:38.250 ,Participant 001,yeah I prefer things in a physical copy of fit something super legal.Because like.Part of a I mean part of me kind of realizes that if it's digital it's more likely to last longer because you can like put it on the cloud or like have it so that you can access it anywhere. But also part of me just kind of feels like it's not very real until I physically felt it in my hands.yeah yeah cuz if it's was just digital then it kind of feels distant or unreal to me for like very temporary I guess.,legality;records-tangible;records-use-records-interaction; ambiguity
01:05:24.180 ,Mya,What about the the sort of knowledge that someone has the records versus you physically having them.,
01:05:40.260 ,Mya,"Like you know that they exist but that you don't have them or even, I guess, like the extension being like your family having them so, for example.hypothetically maybe there's a police record somewhere.",
01:05:58.020 ,Participant 001,"I guess, first, I would feel kind of happy that they still physically exist.hmm and then I would feel.kind of curious.About either who's still holding on to them or how often it gets looked at.mm hmm cuz and if I don't know the person who has it like if it's in a filing cabinet somewhere in some office, then I would kind of just wonder if the person who sort of has it either knows my situation or would know someone else who would know more about it, so it would just kind of be a whole curiosity type of thing.",records-awareness;records-ownership;records-retention;other-people
01:06:52.500 ,Mya,yeah would you want them to care like or and to know about you.,
01:07:01.560 ,Participant 001,"yeah I mean if they already have my file I think i'd feel more comfortable with them having it if they actually cared.yeah yeah or, at least if they kind of knew what they were holding onto area.", care;other-people;records-ownership;records-retention
01:07:13.800 ,Mya,"The knowledge of what they're holding on to in specific relation to you or if, for example, it were the case, records for 5000 people.",
01:07:30.240 ,Participant 001,"Mine would be hidden among a bunch of other case records I guess. Realistically, I know that they wouldn't know me specifically or care specifically but, since those documents are kind of so unique and hard to obtain myself I would kind of prefer that whoever happens to have them would at least have.some degree of knowledge or attachment to it as well.yeah because then yeah then it just kind of feels really like cold and.unfair for something that's so hard to get to be in the hands of someone who doesn't even know how much it means.yeah yeah it's just kind of.weird I guess.",records-access;care;other-people;records-ownership
01:08:33.900 ,Mya,It is sort of funky how.The those documents have like such significance and yet you know filing cabinet random somewhere.,
01:08:51.300 ,Participant 001,Oh i'd also probably be really curious about it my neighbor case. Like how similar they are.,other-adoptees;other-people
01:09:06.480 ,Mya,"yeah I do wonder, like in the context of of like the giant maze of records that I imagine adoption agencies must have like how.Are they filed like are they filed by the name with what name or they filed by like.Is it by number is it by.",
01:09:25.890 ,Participant 001,"I feel like the best way to file, it would be by case number. Yeah yeah because I think case number would probably also go in a chronological order, which would make more sense and would make it easier for them to add files and move the oldest stuff into like archives. Although like a part of me kind of what feels like it be cooler for them to file it under names because, like in movies, you see them like spies flicking through the names and alphabet.",records-retention;logistics;records-desired
01:10:08.490 ,Mya,Is it is it do you do you think that's impersonal that they would use a number or just that's the practicality of it.,
01:10:19.170 ,Participant 001,"Like yeah feels i'm personnel, but it's also just considering how many cases they have and what.I mean what each case really means to the organization objectively makes it's more practical and makes a lot more sense to file everything under numbers.Because I mean the same thing happens at schools, all the students are assigned like student numbers, even though we've all got names, too, but, as it happens, a lot of people have the same names.",care;logistics;records-meaning
01:10:52.920 ,Mya,"yeah Well, you names to change a lot too.yeah I mean that would be interesting, because if if it weren't by name would it therefore have to be like the adoptive parents name because that's the more permanent thing that they know.",
01:11:14.880 ,Participant 001,yeah I mean that would be a lot of hassle and paperwork to have to change it once the adoption is like completely finalized.yeah over from the orphanage name to the adoptive parents names.yeah and yeah honestly yeah that'd be too much work.,records-ownership
01:11:37.320 ,Mya,I actually have a question for you about that um.What.So were you given a name by the unofficial orphanage.,
01:11:49.980 ,Participant 001,"yeah my name is actually given to me by the lady that ran the unofficial orphanage. It's, I have been told, an Americanized version of a Chinese name which makes sense that lady was like an American yeah at least the way it's spelled anyways. My mom says that it was supposed to be the Chinese version of a person in the Bible. Okay, which I am so glad that my mom didn't decide to go with the English [version] then because I don't think I could live with that. Yeah that's just I don't know I don't feel like a [person with the English version of the name].But yeah no apparently my first name was given to me by that lady and I guess, since my mom feels like so much gratitude towards her I kept that name.",other-people;adoption-story;names
01:12:50.400 ,Mya,uh huh.,
01:12:51.630 ,Participant 001,"um yeah so I kept that first name but then I think when I started living with my mom at two years old, she actually don't know when she gave those gave me the other names, but her and my dad named gave me a middle name Faith. They told me that they decided on Faith, because they knew that take a lot of faith for all of the process to get through and be done. It they also told me, it was almost grace; I prefer Faith.",names;adoption-story;pre-adoption
01:13:35.340 ,Mya,Very Christian sounding.,
01:13:37.500 ,Participant 001,"yeah they were very Christian open time. Before I was legally adopted my last name was actually [my dad's last name]. They went with my dad's last name at the time because they were still together, but then they got divorced and I guess they didn't really feel the need to change my last name right after the divorce since I wasn't fully adopted yet and it's just like a whole huge hassle if it doesn't really affect anything anyways.Sure, so a lot of the people in China knew me [by my dad's last name] but then after I got like legally adopted my legal last name became [my mom's] Okay, which I don't really remember how much of a shift that was for me, but I do remember that I did have to learn to start to write my full name [with the correct last name]. Yeah, but I think I probably adjusted to that pretty well since I was distracted by other stuff anyways.wow.", names;adoption-story
01:14:45.750 ,Mya,What about the name that was on the....,
01:14:50.490 ,Participant 001,"certificate yeah yeah I did actually look at that a little earlier before the first interview with you. Yeah um I did realize that there actually was a last name tacked on to that.Like a Chinese one but since it was my legal adoption i've got to assume that it was one from the from the legal orphanage that I was supposedly being adopted from yeah so I don't feel much attachment to that because I've never known about it and I don't think it was ever a part of me. I have no idea if my not legal orphanage ever gave me a last name since, you know they didn't really need it for legal purposes, because I don't think anyone was really registered.", names;records-content;records-meaning;ambivalence
01:16:08.820 ,Mya,um was your your first name on the official documentation like your.,
01:16:13.650 ,Participant 001,"First yeah.yeah yeah yeah even the spelling of it is that character writing of it is the same.yeah which i'm actually not totally sure if I had a character writing of it before I was fully adopted or not.Actually, I feel like I probably did, since I did take like some Chinese classes.",names;records-content
01:16:36.630 ,Mya,uh huh.,
01:16:37.380 ,Participant 001,"But I don't know Maybe it was the same. Yeah I think I did actually because it's the character that like tipped off my Chinese teacher in college, that it is like a very americanized version of it and definitely not traditionally taught Chinese or originally Chinese. Interestingly enough i've never met anyone with the same name as me.",names;birth-culture-interaction
01:17:14.430 ,Mya,really interesting.,

01:17:29.220 ,Mya,In a good or a bad way.,
01:17:32.400 ,Participant 001,I don't know in a 'is that an actual name now' kinda way. Like I've been around a lot of Asian people since I did live in China and Hong Kong for a good chunk of my life. Yeah I was surrounded by like a lot of Chinese people and even like other surrounding Asian countries and never met another [person with my exact name].,names;sticking-out;birth-culture-interaction
01:18:00.450 ,Mya,interesting.,
01:18:01.140 ,Participant 001,"or heard of another [person with my name].My friends have ever met anyone else, with the same name, either at least know where they told me about.huh yeah much makes me kind of wonder is that actually a real name or was I just made up.",name;sticking-out
...,,,
01:18:32.310 ,Participant 001,"I'm hoping that it was a real name before I got it. But it's also kind of cool to have a unique name. Kind of a pain, though, because that also means if it had ever ends up anywhere, everyone will notice me.So I got to be careful.",name;sticking-out

Although I kind of realized that in more international settings with people from all over, when it's like put against a lot of other international names, it seems more normalized. But if it's like in a less international setting like just in general public Canada or U.S., then I get a little bit self conscious sometimes because I don't really want to be able, I don't really want to be like that one person on a list that doesn't match everyone else.yeah yeah, so I would prefer something a little bit more common, but at the same time it's feels kind of cool to have more unique spelling to.",names;sticking-out;asian-diaspora;connection

01:24:36.870 ,Participant 001,"I think they had to match my profile with someone of similar age, but the same name.Okay yeah because I feel like closer to my same age, but a different name in there be like a whole name change, yes, this um.",records-content
01:24:55.440 ,Mya,So I guess then someone else...,
01:24:57.300 ,Participant 001,"I don't know very much about that story aside from the reason why my birthday is different is because it's actually someone else's profile. Yeah so i'm not totally sure if that was actually their name or not. Maybe it was, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't. Because again i've never met anyone else with the same name.Like even in the whole adoptee Facebook group.

01:27:38.520 ,Participant 001,More frustrating. yeah yeah I mean whenever i'm going through application processes it's just a pain in the ass if it's not simple. yeah and at that point is not even an emotional thing it's just a very it's just an annoyance at that.,records-use;sticking-out
01:27:59.940 ,Participant 001,yeah cuz I don't know why legal legal documents and applications are just a huge pain.yeah yeah in.,
01:28:09.180 ,Mya,"sort of in that context, do you do you wish that Like governments or like whoever was sort of processing or creating the paperwork thats related to adoption.took into consideration the fact that the paperwork that someone might have would be that, like so starkly different.",
01:28:30.420 ,Participant 001,"yeah would be nice if people could be a bit more considerate of different circumstances. Yeah yeah also it would be nice if, like adoption agencies would just automatically produce these types of paperwork, or at least like standards for them. Although I honestly don't know if those will even be legally recognized if they did. Ifeel like that would be another whole painful process of having to deal with each country's government to get them to actually be able to produce legitimate documents..",records-creation;records-onus;records-content;adoption-industry
01:29:12.000 ,Mya,"Should that not be their problem, though, given that they're interacting with different governments like a central you by choice they're choosing to engage in business in those places.",
01:29:25.110 ,Participant 001,"yeah man from a business objective standpoint they're already offering one service it's not really that that big of a deal if they just happen to not have another service. Or that other service just doesn't really work in some places. There's just so many things to take into account. I mean, I personally find it hard to be mad at the Adoption Agency or governments, because I just know like how much of a pain in the ass the paperwork is and how hard it is to get things like done communicated turned around and approved and whatnot so yeah I think I think, considering it from that standpoint, makes it a little bit easier, not to hold any resentment. yeah because I know there are apparently a lot of adoptees a hold a lot of resentment. I did not realize that was a thing until shortly after joining that group.",records-onus;post-adoption-services;records-creation;records-barriers;logistics;other-adoptees;adoption-industry
01:30:39.000 ,Mya,there's certainly some vocal people in there.,
01:30:41.910 ,Participant 001,"It's too bad they have that much anger directed sometimes at the wrong person. So i'm trying to look at things like from a less emotional view to kind of avoid that happening because I did like in my angsty phase as a teenager I did definitely have quite a bit of  anger and resentment, but then I kind of realized when I took a step back that every circumstances are what they are. You can't really change them there's always going to be reasons and things for each person involved that you'll never know that either can either justify what they did or just provide some explanation, but don't quite justify it or explain how there are no other options yeah",adoption-conversations;adoption-industry
