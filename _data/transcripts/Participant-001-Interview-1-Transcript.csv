00:00:06.750,Mya,"Excellent so i'm just to start off if you'd be willing to just sort of give a little bit of an introduction to yourself, who you are.",
00:00:34.200,Participant 001,"Sure, so hi i'm Mali. I'm twenty two and live in Canada. I'm adopted from Guangdong province. um yeah like the really brief history of it is that I was born in China started living with my mom when I was two years old. Officially legally adopted at seven and then moved to the US until I was fifteen and then moved to Hong Kong for like three years of high school and then move to Canada where I am now. let's see that and I really like to eat noodles and general Asian food. Oh, and I love coffee now did it needs to like it, but then became a barista and now like officially addicted to it.",adoption-story
00:02:48.330,Mya,"I would be interested in hearing a little bit more about like your adoption story, how you remember being sort of How, like all of the moves that you made all of the changes that happened, how you remember being like told what was happening or if there was sort of A time when you learned a little bit more about what happened in your life afterwards, like now that you're older and can sort of understand.",
00:03:17.940,Participant 001,"Okay, so then long story. The long story is: back before I was born my mom actually worked for the Holt Adoption Agency. That's actually how she met me; she was traveling around Asia. I'm still not totally sure what her job was, something about liaison project coordinating whatever the heck, but she did meet a lot of the babies. She was actually traveling in Guangdong around 1999 and then she met me and then, from what I heard she fell in love with me. and decided to actually move to China with my dad. the thing about my adoption story, though, is that it's a little bit more legally complicated because my was abandoned at five days old at or i'm told was a retirement home and I guess whoever found me took me to this Christian lady who was running an unofficial orphanage And like if you know anything about the laws in China their various tricks about orphanages and shit but yeah they took me to her, she was running like an unofficial orphanage I think on the outside, it was actually supposed to be a day care Center for kids with disabilities in China, like farmers if they couldn't take care of their disabled kids didn't have her watch over them for. I think either the day or I don't know what anyways she also side hustle was taking care of a lot of other babies. But the problem with that is she was kind of illegal because she didn't actually pay all the legal processing funds or whatever to be considered an orphanage so everyone there didn't actually have any paperwork. So I didn't have any paperwork at all, so it basically didn't exist so. i'm not really sure how my mom was actually involved with that I think holds was probably like giving her supplies to help her take care of the babies, probably, but like still not illegal orphanage anyways she moved my mom have to China run. I should know when she moved I just know I started living with her when I was two years old. This is where they told me yeah so I started living with her in China, when I was two years old, and since the whole process legally was very complicated because you know no starting paperwork. It wasn't until I was seven that everything was finalized legally and then I got my American passport and then we were able to finally move out of China to the US So, with the actual official adoption They had to actually say that I came from a different legal orphanage which I had never actually lived in before, which is why I know any paperwork connected to that is complete bs and no way true because i'm not totally sure about it, but I think, because my memory is a little bit fuzzy that they actually use the identity of another orphan there who didn't really make it and I guess died at some point, but had like the similar age and name as me, which is how I ended up with two birthdays so my legal birthday is actually not what my Estimated birthday is.", adoption-story; adoption-industry; logistics; legality
00:07:05.670,Participant 001,"And my mom only knows my estimated one because she had actually met me before my legal one. yeah so any actual paperwork before I was legally adopted would actually be tied to that identity and not me at all, but then. yeah my mom managed to pull some strings and actually get me adopted with her, because at that time I think she was one of the last women to be able to adopt as a single mother, because during that time, my mom and dad got divorced when they were in China, it was yeah complicated yeah and then moved to the US after that yeah.", adoption-story; logistics
00:07:50.310,Participant 001,"Oh, I guess, I also grew up in this weird evangelical Christian Community full of a bunch of international missionaries, who all had adopted other Asian children, and when I ever recount that whole experience to other family members or friends, they are like oh yeah that sounds very culty and when I think back on it, it *was* kind of culty. My parents used to be bound to that I found jellicoe and then my mom became an atheist at some point in China. And I think my dad just kind of became less intense yeah.", adopted-culture
00:08:43.980,Mya,Do you remember when you first learned about how complicated your situation was?,
00:08:55.950,Participant 001,"not really my mom has always been very transparent about the whole process to me, also because I do remember being told certain things like. In China, they would occasionally take like a random census check or whatever, and like knock on people's doors and ask who's living there and I. Think, I remember at some point my mom did tell me if that ever happens to basically hide in my room, because at that point, it didn't have any legal paperwork. But if they did find me I think she probably could have figured something out since she was kind of fostering me. But I also do remember I couldn't go to the school that my dad was teaching at because he taught at an international Christian school, which was more official and kind of required the students to have passports and whatnot. At that point, I didn't have any real legal paperwork or passport so I had to go to a less the showy Christian missionary school. It was probably like the more casual and cheaper and less intense option that didn't actually require a bunch of paperwork to get into, so I guess i've always known that my situation was a little bit different. I don't think I fully comprehend it, but I just kind of accepted as the reality as it was. And also like a good chunk of my friends at that age were also adopted too because, you know, cult, a community that had a bunch of international missionaries which, when I think about it now seemed like they were just collecting children but sure whatever.", adoption-story;logistics; legality; white-saviorism
00:10:44.700,Mya,"So I was going to ask you, like what your experience was living in China, but being the child of someone who was not Chinese but where you mostly just living within that Community so it wasn't as much.",
00:10:58.110,Participant 001,"Yeah, mostly. Unfortunately I never really picked up Mandarin very well. My parents did have like a Chinese nanny who would take care of me most of the time, since they were both working full time, so I think I spent a good chunk of my time with her. #TODO I called her wonky and she took care of me, she taught I think her English wasn't super great, so I think we did speak a little bit of Mandarin but I wasn't very great at it. And I mostly just grew up in with English and stayed within the community, mostly. Because it was kind of like in a gated district area, so I couldn't really travel outside of about myself, and it was those two #TODO yo. And everyone kind of lived in the same area and they always have like a lot of Community meetings and gatherings anyways because you know church Bible studies, Bible bowling I don't know. I mean the kids were fun, but the adults were terrifying. Seriously, like super strict.I don't think I would be able to survive in that community now because I did actually reach out to a few of them quite a few years ago--like after getting back on Facebook and realizing oh, maybe I should connect with my old childhood friends, and the figure out what they're up to--and then realized 'Oh, thank God, I didn't get adopted into those families.' If it's not totally obvious, I'm gay, and that community is, I found out later, kind of mildly homophobic. They are missionary enough that they don't exactly want to start screaming yelling that you're going to go to hell, but they are like still evangelical enough that they will internally think 'oh yeah they're definitely to hell.' But yeah also depends on who you ask. I haven't actually talked to the adults, yet, because they still scare me even to this day. But their children are all right.", birth-culture-interaction; adopted-culture
00:13:25.350,Mya,When you move to the states did you experience a lot of culture shock or was it sort of not as much because you had been living in that like international community.,
00:13:38.130,Participant 001,"There was definitely some culture shock. Although I think I took it mostly as just being very excited because when I lived in China, a lot of the missionaries were American too. And my parents definitely missed the US because they couldn't visit with me since I couldn't fly, so they were kind of stuck there for like pretty much seven years. So they kind of talked up the whole thing to me and I did watch like some American TV when we could find like an English version of it. So I kind of saw the whole experience I was like oh my God and finally going to the US, land of the freedom and bald eagles and pancakes.", adopted-culture
00:14:18.990,Mya,Do you think you identified as American?,
00:14:23.490,Participant 001,"I say, that I'm 'legally' American now, but I actually only lived in the US for seven years out of my 22 years. Because only lived there for seven years, so I don't really feel that connected to it. But yeah the first year I was there was mostly exciting. I was really excited to like actually meet new people and basically finally be able to watch cable TV, #TODO because in China there's like a lot of stuff Well, first of all everything's in Chinese and I can't actually read Chinese very well and am not very good at understanding most of it, so I watched a lot of Sponge Bob reruns. #TODO In China, it was pretty sure I like saw this rewatch. All of the DVDs for about five years straight and it was very excited about the US some things that were definitely a huge shock or how sweet everything was but. I quickly found out that I could not handle very much sugar compared to other American kids. My mom like she likes that so anytime I went trick or treating I ended up giving her more than half of my candy anyways.", identity; connection
00:15:43.620,Participant 001,I think there were just like a lot of other things happening in the family background that kind of made me not really dwell the whole culture shock as much. We moved to the West Coast and my mom a year later ended up like finding another boyfriend so we moved. I gained a step brother and sister who were a little bit older than me and went from being a single child to suddenly having older siblings which ended up being its own culture shock too.,
00:16:31.410,Mya,What kind of schools did you go to?,
00:16:39.960,Participant 001,"Oh yeah so it in the US, I was public schools huh which actually only thing about it, though, is also huge. Cost one and China, since it was like a Christian private school. They use these weird booklet programs called paces have you heard of that it's basically like a booklet full of. Questions and you just fill it out, I think I forget which he start doing it by herself, but at some point just have like your own little office you fill out the booklet. And then, when you're done you raise a little flag and then a monitor comes by and like escort suit to be correcting station where you just like match your answers to the correct thing booklet and if you pass you do a little test and move on to the next booklet so it's very like self Driven education which honestly not totally sure how good of an education, it was because Some of the tests did require you to like recite Bible verses in order to move on Interest yeah yeah then, when I look back on it later some of the high school questions seemed a bit Like, why did God create so and so yeah anyways and went from there to public school, which was very fun and exciting got to learn a lot of new things and see a lot of people and enjoy the chaos of what is public school recess. And um yeah but after I was in the US, and then we moved to Hong Kong, when I was fifteen years old. I actually went to a British private school there. Okay, which also a huge shift, they are so different. yeah like not even just how they say words, although for like the first month anytime anyone said process or progress, like my mind would just halt and we stuck in the whole pro part. yeah I know that was that was a bit of a rougher ride, and my younger years because, like when you're younger everything's new anyway, so you just kind of take it as it is.",adopted-culture
00:18:51.210,Mya,"You mentioned that in the school in China that pretty much everyone was adopted, so there was sort of a sort of shared similarity between you and your classmates, but in the context of your other schools, did you find that like kids when they would see like your mom would they ask you questions or...?",
00:19:15.150,Participant 001,"Yeah, I guess, I did not really realize how rare it was. To find another adopted person or even like another Asian person for a little while when I first moved, but I might generally very oblivious person. And don't notice very much if I don't really seem that important like I didn't realize that rice was considered Asian until like I was 11 years old. And went to like dinner at one of my best friend's house and realize that every time i'm there they always have potatoes and they never have rice. Because my mom think i'd would always like cook rice every night for me.",other-adoptees; connection; birth-culture-exposure
00:19:51.060, Participant 001,"I guess I'm realizing that once I was in the US nearly everyone was kind of white, but I didn't really know very much about American culture, yet, so I guess I didn't really notice how different everything was until like around middle school I guess instead in elementary school everything was just Oh well, shiny new things.", adopted-culture
00:20:29.820,Paritcipant 001,"i'm trying to think if I met any other adopted people. In middle school I did meet two twins that were actually adopted from Central America, but we weren't really friends much because we didn't have that much in common aside from that. And it wasn't really a huge part of my whole life or not being adopted wasn't really something I thought about much until I was around thirteen or fourteen actually because, by then, you know teenage angst kind of a lot of self reflection And all that stuff. A lot of anxiety teen poetry and whatnot. yeah I cringe at times so.",other-adoptees; adoptedness-centrality
00:21:29.130,Mya,"You mentioned your mom like cooking rice every night did too cheap tried to incorporate a lot of Chinese culture like into your sort of regular household I mean obviously when you were in China, there was.",
00:21:41.760,Participant 001,"yeah when I was in China our nanny did all the cooking and basically taking care of me, and so I kind of developed like an Asian palette for food anyways. And I think, while I was there, my parents kind of realized that I didn't care that much for some typically American stuff like For one thing, I never liked cheese. I cannot stand any sort of cheese; there was a very brief period in my life where the only kind I could tolerate was American cheese, because that was barely even cheese. But yeah no, I think I just kind of got used to always have it like rice and noodles. So when I moved to the US, I think my parents were just trying to like help ease me into everything and basically just agreeing to any type of food I wanted. So at first, it was pancakes for like about a week. But then, after that, I just wanted to Chinese food again so they usually did that. Also, my step siblings are half Japanese on their mom's side, so my step dad, their dad was white, but they were used to like some Asian food too so whenever my stepsiblings were over, we'd usually have like teriyaki chicken and rice and steamed broccoli which got old real real fast. But you know everyone else was like super picky eaters: I didn't like cheese; my sister, for some reason didn't eat beef; my mom was allergic to pork; and both my step siblings didn't like seafood yet, so that's very limited options. But like rice was one of the few basis that we could all agree on .",birth-culture-exposure;connection;identity
00:23:35.190,Participant 001,"#TODO that's good I could read it, I can't like eat rice every day and used to have rice, milk and sugar for breakfast. I think actually preferred that to cereal because I found an American cereals, to be like to sugary usually. Like you know lucky charms I usually just pick out the marshmallows and prefer to eat the marshmallow.",connection
00:24:04.230,Mya,"Did you especially I guess like as you've gotten older I don't know, are you still in touch or do you relate well with your step siblings?",
00:24:17.340,Participant 001,"I talk to my sister once in a while. My step brother, we didn't really get along very well because. He's also gay but, like in the opposite direction so we're like very opposite personality personalities and having nothing in common, so we don't really talk very often. But my sister and I, we do like chat about some things once in a while, but not too much. Plus they all live in different places; I'm the only person in my family in Canada right now. Okay yeah like my mom and stepdad and step brother are on the East Coast right now and  My stepsister's in and  my dad's most of my mom and dad's families are scattered around the West Coast.",
00:25:05.790,Mya,"I was going to ask--I guess this also applies in relation to your parents to although it's a little different, since they are white--but because your step siblings were Half Asian, did you find ever like that conversations about like your racial identity or just like being able to feeling you live in a different way, as compared to your parents",
00:25:31.080,Participant 001,"not really I think some of the deeper emotional topics were generally avoided which I was kind of glad about because I usually wanted to avoid talking about them, since I found my mom got a little bit emotional whenever the subject of my adoption came up. I understand that was actually like a lot of work for her to. Because yeah, it was definitely a big move for her and my dad for something that wasn't guaranteed at all. There were probably a few times where they weren't sure that the adoption process would actually go through or that I would even be able to ever leave China. But yeah, she usually gets very emotional and usually nearly starts crying so I usually kind of avoid that around her. Well in terms of like racial identity, I never really cared that much about it, yet while, I was in the US. And my step siblings were actually kind of denying that side about them for quite a while. I don't really know why. It was kind of hard, because both of them usually didn't like many things that were Asian yet. Like, as I said, they're half Japanese but they didn't like seafood or seaweed. And when I tried to eat seafood instant noodles in the House they'd literally kicked me out into the backyard. because they didn't like the smell of it. Such hypocrites; they make mac and cheese and I didn't like the smell, but anyways I think they also avoided the topics they didn't like talking about it and they had a pretty strained relationship with their step dad too, so we rarely have like huge family discussions about anything. #TODO My stepdad is kind of more of the aloof type and doesn't really like talking about serious topics either, so it was generally avoided I guess. Like I knew that they were all pretty socially liberal and he was so I'd never really had any worries about them being any type of like homophobic racist sort of, although I guess my step dad and some of like our extended family would sometimes make general remarks or slightly racist comments, but you know this is kind of how they were less their own beard bluntness slash humor slash grumpiness but yeah.",race-conversations; conversation-barriers; connection; racism
00:28:05.730,Mya,I guess sort of a sense of camaraderie or similarity in the fact that your your step siblings were half Asian.,
00:28:20.220,Participant 001,"One of the reasons why I don't get along with my step brother is because he was in a lot of self denial at the time when he when he was in high school and middle school like he would, for some reason be very racist and homophobic despite him being much more flamboyant than me to the point where I was surprised that he was surprised that I wasn't surprised when he came out to us.",race-conversations; conversation-barriers; racism
00:29:14.220, Participant 001,"Anyways ya know they usually made fun of me because usually around my birthday, I would request to go to the huge Asian supermarket in the city which was like 40 minutes drive; we rarely went. I would usually like to stock up on instant noodles and Asian snacks and they didn't really care much for it because, again, they didn't like seafood yet and they, well, I feel like they didn't actually fully accept that they were also Asian until they went to college. Much less I guess made Christmas is after that a little bit nicer yeah yeah.",race-conversations; conversation-barriers

00:30:16.830, Participant 001,"Even when I was in the US, I generally felt more Chinese since living in the US still felt kind of foreign to me. yeah English is like the only language I could speak and I probably wouldn't be able to survive and turn on my own, but still, although recently actually a couple years ago I found out on 23 and me then i'm actually seventy Vietnamese and only thirty percent Chinese. And yeah so the 23andme test like. Eight years ago we think yeah back then I couldn't really differentiated, but then a couple years ago they updated it And then I found out that I was actually seventy percent. And then, since then i've been eating a lot of. Good food to eat. And also, since then i've been a bit confused about if i'm supposed to under like race if i'm supposed to put. Like just East Asian or Southeast Asian because. They always list Vietnam under Southeast Asian, even though China and Vietnam are like super close and southern China and northern Vietnam or yeah really very different, so it gets a bit confusing so yeah yeah I try to just do like the general Asian Muslim on now, since I found out i'm also partly Vietnamese if it's only talking about race and ethnicity or whatnot then we'll probably check both East and southeast but.",identity; connection; connection; DNA-testing; created-facts; truthfulness-and-accuracy

Um I think I do end up disclosing that to most of my friends and maybe some co-workers because it does get confusing when the topic of my birthday comes up. Yes, legally on all of my documents it says my birthday is in the summer, but then when I celebrate and the one that I put on Facebook is in the spring. Same year, it's just really annoying.

Also anytime we talked about my family since they're kind of an unconventional family. They usually get very confused until I clarify that they're they're white and without it. yeah and then that that answers a lot of the questions oh also anytime they asked me about my name because [my last name] is not Asian at all. yeah yeah yeah, although sometimes I like to play around and tell them that I'm actually half Irish and half German.",adoptedness-centrality; logistics; adoption-conversations

Like I like to think that I've made my peace with it, which, if I'm being honest means I probably have just been avoiding topic mostly.

She used to work in the Adoption Agency and I've actually found books that she's owned that are like about raising an adoptee and I actually read through some of them or skimmed the titles of some of them and man, some of them are depressing, but also very accurate. But yeah, so I think she kind of knew more about what to expect than me so. She's probably signed me up, so I thought, 'Oh, what the hell it'd be nice to know and I could see if i'm like related to anyone.' I can only find like fourth cousins or further on there.

But even [once I had the legal date] we always celebrated the spring one I think; after elementary school or middle school I didn't really care that much for celebrating it. Because, for one thing I just generally don't like parties about me because I feel it's like just too much attention and too much stress and people. And then after like the whole teengager and adoption self reflection angst and what not, I even more didn't like it because it just gets kind of depressing, if you think about it. I usually just try to get through it without people really making a big deal, like at the most I'll probably just ask for a nice Asian dinner. Or consider it a good excuse for myself to order a bunch of really yummy food that I usually wouldn't. But even if I don't like making a big deal out of it, it did kind of get a little annoying when sometimes my family would like slightly forget about it, since my sister's birthday is actually a week before mine. And she actually likes having birthday parties so they made a bigger deal out of her birthday kind of like spilled over into my week so sometimes they kind of forget and be like oh wait now it's your birthday weekend. After like the whole month building up to hers, one time I had to wait in the car have a target parking lot will they want it to target define me something for my birthday That was all right though there's an rei right next to it, and my step dad bought me like a really cool pocket knife so It was forgiven.",adoptedness-centrality;identity; created-facts
00:45:15.510,Mya,Did you and your parents ever celebrate the day that you were like officially adopted?,
00:45:25.110,Participant 001,"not really because even that's kind of complicated I think before. yeah before my last couple years of high school my mom was the only one that really acknowledged my adoption day which i'm forget what that day even was it was sometime in December, but like sometime in December she'd be like oh hey it's your adoption day i'd be like oh cool and then maybe we go out for food, but no, it was never really a big celebration day it was more interest like acknowledging, it also The day I started living with her and the day I was legally adopted are both in December and it's kind of hard to say which one is like the adoption day It was never really one of those big things so just kind of like oh let's acknowledge this happened and yeah i'm so thankful for you and then go get food and eat our feelings are not talking about anything yeah so my at least my mom is a very big believer in eating feelings and celebrating with food, which I think i've taken that on to if there's anything we're celebrating its we're celebrating with food.", logistics; legality; logistics; adoption-story

00:47:04.740,Participant 001,"When I was applying for my study permit in Canada, I think one of my adoption papers was actually required so my mom did forward me a very blurry copy of it, so I don't really totally remember what it is, but I think it was my adoption paper but it's all in Chinese. yeah so I don't know I just know it has like a picture of us when I was seven and then her name my name and also a last name added my name, which I don't recognize so it be from the orphanage that I never lived at. Um yeah so I'm assuming that's my adoption paper. Aside from that, and my passport i've never. I don't remember seeing anything else. But then again I also never really asked cuz she usually got very emotional about it, and when she starts crying and I start crying it's just a whole big mess that even ice cream can't fix. yeah I have considered if I should like contact Holt because they do do that whole like yeah pulling up papers thing. And I kind of realized yeah that stuff's probably not super accurate considering I don't really have anything from before I was seven And if there was anything from before I was seven and that's probably illegal.", legality; logistics; adoption-story;records-awareness; records-clarity-and-content;conversation-barriers; records-barriers; post-adoption-services

Interesting yeah like I think, someone said that you're not supposed to touch a baby you're supposed to like call the police or something to pick it up. And also I'm pretty sure it's illegal to abandon the baby so any information about the birth parents would have to be like super super secret or otherwise they would actually get in trouble if it ever like link back to them. That's the explanation I read when people were saying stuff about fabricated information in their adoption files But then again I also never really looked at my own so yeah well, maybe it would be nice to know that stuff kind of useful so i'm probably asked my mom later check it asked my aunt actually one of my aunt's on my dad's side still works for Holt",legality; records-awareness; other-adoptees;adoption-industry; truthfulness-and-accuracy;information-limits; records-content; adoption-industry

Okay, like really distant like I think I have some cousins on my mom's side but they're like.

00:50:38.640,Participant 001,"No my dad was a teacher. They got married pretty young, definitely too young I don't know how they ever got married. They're complete opposites; I'm surprised that they even like survived being together enough to like actually move to China. But ya know they got married really young, you know college sweethearts and whatnot. And when he got to China, he just got a job as an international teacher really. So he's always been a teacher, since then.

00:51:57.600,Participant 001,"Probably yeah like there are some clarifying questions i'd like to ask, or like even ask her to tell the stories, because what I know is just like bits and pieces from different times she's told it. Because usually she's not telling it to me she's usually telling it to one of her friends does she. And it's kind of a weird thing, I guess, so my mom is like a lot of friends and I don't know why, but she often invites me to lunch with them. And if they ever asked about my adoption she just goes like full steam ahead into the whole telling the story thing which I don't really mind. But that's usually how I hear most of how I remember, most of the details because again my memory sucks. And after a while of it being like super transparent you kind of just take some things for granted and don't really like store them in your information file and then later on, forget oh wait was that really bad was it that. yeah if she were super emotionally attached to all that which feel like kind of an asshole saying that, but I feel like it would be easier to ask her dislikes about the general facts and whatnot but i'm kind of afraid that if I do she's going to read too much into that and get very sensitive or want to talk about things And i'm going to avoid into personally I don't really want to get too much into it Much into it.", information-limits; conversation-barriers; for-you-not-for-you

And I think the only reason why she could choose to adopt man was because. I originally had like a heart murmur so it was like I mean I don't have it anymore just went away someday, but I think, because I could technically count a special needs, then people can actually have a choice and don't get randomly assigned.

I am pretty sure that meeting happened, though cuz I remember that request being kind of weird.

So I probably did meet her a few times, but then again i'm not like a lot of adults, because. My parents were so social So I don't like fully.

But maybe that's because I was already in Canada. So if I want to get PR them might be required, who knows. But i'm in general, everything else that required ids usually they were happy with just my us passport. mm hmm yeah cuz I mean I don't really have anything like a birth certificate, so if they require something more than that, and that just gets kind of troublesome yeah oh wait I think my mom may have needed that as proof of her connection to me.",records-use

Until I got adopted and suddenly my last my last name change. um, although I guess my mom was nice enough to include [his last name] in my in one of my middle names.

We don't do very much emotional bonding about anything at all so yeah yeah I really have no idea, but I think he would be happier consider considering how he doesn't have any other kids. His family's kind of small to so his brother his his only sibling and his brother also doesn't have any kids so I kind of feel bad for my grandparents because there's no one continuing their line. yeah yeah cuz I also don't plan on having kids so I mean, I feel like it make us feel slightly closer, even if we don't talk about it but I don't think it's really.

Since she's moved a lot, I honestly don't know she keeps any original files anywhere, because I think they got rid of their storage unit on the West Coast a few years ago  um So it makes me a little bit sad when I think about it, because I know like her parents and my dad's parents rarely move, so they almost always have like everything with them, whereas my parents move a lot and kind of just keep the necessities with them. So I don't even know if she has any like paper copies of anything like she clearly has at least a digital copy but. yeah and holt probably has some it's just like so much work to have to like actually figure out where things are and they're like ask the right person about it so, is it like such a hassle yeah some more annoying yeah.", records-awareness;records-ownership;records-barriers;records-absence

But I would not want a Chinese passport, I did originally have that before swap to American. That got punched with holes, because once you swap it can really cool and then, just like seriously, to put it to a hole puncher. yeah no a Canadian would be nice yeah yeah. i'd even like throw away my us citizenship. no desire to live me was Even if my whole family's there I would be fine with just visiting them, maybe like once a year.",
