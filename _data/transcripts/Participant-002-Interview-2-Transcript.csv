00:00:42.000 ,Participant 002,"The comic was definitely interesting. It's just like, you know, being confronted with the fact that all your documents could be lying and then they're actively people who are still trying to lie to you.",truthfulness-and-accuracy;records-content;other-people
00:01:00.810 ,Mya,"In the way that they sort of portray how that works in the context of going through like an adoption agency like from your perspective, having worked for an adoption agency is that sort of strange that that someone like in a position, not unlike yours would be doing that [lying] and, obviously, if it's at a larger scale in the context of.",
00:01:29.430 ,Participant 002,"A bit different, because where I live there's actually a law that muzzle adoption agencies from giving out documents; you have to go through the government. I don't remember when, though, it was passed. So when I was there, we could give people their files, or copies of their files, and like direct them to an agent or the organizations in China or like the government and say 'You should probably try and contact them' but we didn't have much of a role beyond that in terms of searching. Its kind of like 'here's what we can give you, here at the contacts we can give you, but you are kind of on your own because we also don't know.' Because, like, we were handed the documents of what people told us.",records-access;adoption-industry;post-adoption-services;information-limits
00:02:39.210 ,Mya,yeah.,
00:02:39.870 ,Participant 002,"You know, and then I don't know when this law came into effect, or if potentially we just didn't realize it was there, but there is some kind of law that prevents adoption agencies from giving out information, even to the adoptee, they have to go through the province and I think like it's more of a like request it might take a while because: bureaucracy, but I don't believe it's closed or it's not closed anymore.",records-access;adoption-industry;post-adoption-services;information-limits
00:03:11.160 ,Mya,"Does the fact that that law adds another layer feel like it is obstructive to people being able to get information about themselves?",
00:03:28.440 ,Participant 002,"I would  imagine so. It seems stupid, like this in mine. It's information about me. Why can't you just give me a copy of it?",records-ownership;other-people
00:03:37.770 ,Mya,"mm hmm That was the thing, also within like the graphic novel that I thought was interesting was that the line right that they kept giving her was like oh this technically belongs to your birth parents like you have to have their permission to see it.",
00:03:50.400 ,Participant 002,"I think most provinces have like open records in Canada. I know in the States it's kind of a mismatch, but what they did when they decided to open up adoption records because it's relatively recently too, they were like 'if you're a birth parent, you can file ahead of time'--There was this grace period to say 'could you still seal off our names?' And so it's kind of a whoever does it first. So if the birth parent did it first and they didn't want their information in there, it doesn't matter what the adoptee wants, they got to it first when they're opening the records. I can't remember, but I think that was probably most provinces--if you're a birth parent, you can request to have your information still closed.",
00:04:51.300 ,Mya,"I know that we've sort of talked about how the the there's like significant like documentary differences between the Korean experiences and Chinese experiences and like even in the instance of like comparing what records you have versus like what your sisters have being different. Does the experience of reading or seeing or like just even like talking to people and realizing that they have more even if they're in a not the similar situation, is that uncomfortable or does that does that make you wish that you had certain things?",
00:05:41.000 ,Participant 002,"Not uncomfortable but it definitely makes me wish that I had it.",records-absence;records-desired
00:05:46.000,Mya,"I know you mentioned that like, in particular, for you, that the abandonment certificate was something that you really wish you had. Is that mostly, just so you would have the information or does that represents like something about I guess your situation that that makes it feel different and.",
00:06:08.700 ,Participant 002,"I think both. Yeah, to have a concrete, or at least as concrete as I choose to believe it is, You know, 'here's where we found you' sort of thing. I think... comforting isn't really the right word, but to know, but to have it, to know.",records-content;records-absence;records-meaning;truth-and-accuracy

00:06:55.830 ,Participant 002,"I mean, not in any real official capacity, but like you mentioned last meeting, like the the scrapbook you know where that was for me.And they kept all the  documents they had right, that was for me so that I could have them. But the documents themselves, it's more of like an official thing; I don't necessarily view them as they were for me.",records-content;records-ownership;records-meaning;records-retention
00:07:27.360 ,Mya,"mm hmm.You know yeah is that.If that were something that were to be created hypothetically is that something that you would want enough an official capacity, like a document that is intended for an adoptee created by like a government agency?",
00:07:58.830,Participant 002,"I mean, it would probably be... You have the generic like birth certificate, the adoption certificate, like medical report, 'this child is healthy,' but I think.... Like my parents compiled all of these and kept them. I think the government should be going here are the records that we have of you that's not necessarily, just like the big official ones like a birth certificate right and go and give them to the adoptive parents or to the adoptee depending on how old they are and go 'here's our records of this child'.",records-ownership;records-retention;records-content;records-onus
00:08:28.410 ,Mya,"Is that something that should happen like right away? I mean I think something that's interesting about searches right is it tends to be that [adoption agencies] won't engage with you until you're actually an adult right so is that something that you would imagine or that you would want to happen, like at the time of adoption?",
00:08:55.620 ,Participant 002,"Yeah. I think first of all, it means everyone, you have it from the beginning. Like all of these documents, like I had them, since I was a kid, I just didn't care. But if I cared, but when I started to care, it was just a matter of going to our basement and digging them out. So I do, I can't imagine having to go like when I started caring and it's like well you're gonna have to do this and this and this and contact all these people internationally... And it's not even for searching, I just want to see them. I don't know if I would have bothered.",records-ownership;records-access;records-interaction
00:09:41.730 ,Mya,"Do you have a sense of like what changed or what or what sort of first, made like the note in your mind, like, 'I want to see these documents, this is something that has significance.'",
00:10:03.450 ,Participant 002,"When I was working out the adoption agency and we would receive people's documents and I was like 'well, I want to know what mine are, then, because now, I know what I should be looking for.",records-awareness;records-content
00:10:21.120 ,Mya,"Would you say that you were aware of their existence before that point or would you not have even known like to ask?",
00:10:39.900 ,Participant 002,"I was aware of some of their existence. I didn't know what a home study was, it was just like a thick book. I don't even think I'd looked at it before. It was because when I was applying to get my passport and my health card, it does say a birth certificate, but you can also use your citizenship card. From what I've read from posts in SAAT, it seems like a much less Labor-intensive process of gathering documents than in the States, so because it was like going through the list birth certificate? No, I don't have Canadian one, and then I was like oh, a citizenship card? Have it, that's all I need.",records-awareness;records-content;records-absence;records-interaction
00:11:24.450 ,Mya,"Does the fact that you don't really need the documents per se like to be able to go about your I guess legal like bureaucratic related life in Canada, like affect the perceived I guess importance of the documents.",
00:11:51.600 ,Participant 002,"I think it used to. Because I can't use my Chinese documents for anything really like I don't *need* it, I haven't really encountered a situation where I needed them, so before I really cared about it yeah that I didn't care about them. I mean, they've gotten more of a you know I guess kind of sentimental sort of importance.less so, like, they still don't really have much legal  importance to me, but I am definitely much more cognizant of them.",records-use;records-meaning
00:12:29.640 ,Mya,"yeah do you find that their existence is I guess Like validating of your racial or cultural like sense of identity in any way, any more than just the color of your skin or the fact that you know you were."
00:12:52.140 ,Participant 002,"Kind of? I've never really needed validating in that way. But it's proof that you know I had a semblance of a life in China.",records-meaning
00:13:09.210 ,Mya,"Do you this, despite the fact that they don't necessarily hold any.Information about them, do you do, you find that those documents also potentially symbolize or reference I guess a connection to your birth parents.Or is it more just you.Really.",
00:13:34.590 ,Participant 002,"Not really. They're a connection to my life in China, but they don't actually have anything like I don't ever... Maybe if I had a bad and I certificate, but my birthday is made up, my name is made up right? I mean theoretically everyone's names are made up, but they weren't given to me by my birth parents and so I don't really think they have a connection to my birth parents.",created-facts;records-meaning
00:14:10.950 ,Mya,"Do the people that they have connections to your records, like either the folks that created them or that are documented in there as people who have who had interactions with you... Do you have any interest in them, or like connection, do you feel any of that connection to those people.",
00:14:37.800 ,Participant 002,"Not really. It was kind of a surprise that there's the name of like the orphanage director and one of the doctors and then you have the notary people too who translated them. I don't think I felt a real connection to them, but it was like 'fun fact, this orphanage director was this guy.'", other-people
00:15:02.730 ,Mya,"When you've looked at your records, would you say that you felt differently about them than going through anyone else's records or did going through other people's records or like helping to process those about similar thoughts or emotions, in the same ways?",
00:15:27.210 ,Participant 002,"For when I worked at the adoption agency, it was more of a 'here's what I should be looking for.' or here's the checklist of documents that they need that theoretically, I should also have. [I was curious if] they went to a lot of detail [in the homestudy] about why they picked in China, especially you know... I mentioned this before, I'm not vehemently against international adoption, but you know you do have to kind of start thinking about you know why would your white parents want to adopt from China.",adoption-industry;records-awareness;
00:16:58.500 ,Mya,"Would you say that the the information that you found and there's different from the like reasons or sort of the story that your parents if, like verbally told you, in the past.",
00:17:10.440 ,Participant 002,"I don't even know if they've told me explicitly why. It was more kind of a an inference.This is probably why. And then it was more or less confirmed, when I read the home study.",adoption-story;adoption-conversations
00:17:29.610 ,Mya,"Did the fact that the information wasn't that different from what you had surmised, Was that like I guess sort of comforting is a weird word but it was it sort of Nice in a way that it wasn't that dramatically different?",
00:17:50.520 ,Participant 002,"Yeah and I also... I don't want to say too much about my parents, but it was comforting that it wasn't raising huge white savior flags is what I'll say",white-saviorism
00:18:06.330 ,Mya,"I you mentioned you haven't really talked to them, or they haven't talked to you conversely, but do you think that the fact or as its presented within those documents versus the way that they might talk to you about it...Do you think that those are inherently different just because of the I guess audience that they were intended for?",
00:18:48.210 ,Participant 002,"I mean, probably.",
00:18:49.560 ,Mya,yeah like.,
00:18:50.280 ,Participant 002,"Not that I think they'd lie, but I don't know well, if I asked when I was little [they would maybe adjust their response]. But if I wanted to sit down have a conversation with them now, I do think it would probably be more closer to what's written, but still kind of instead of you know, a kind of clinical home study written by social worker, it's: Here's my experiences.",adoption-conversations;records-content;other-people
00:19:17.910 ,Mya,"yeah is it.I mean there's there's a certain level of I guess objectivity that bureaucratic documents have to have within them, in order for them to be what they are supposed to be, but is it frustrating or like disappointing that that the documentation of like sort of your parents thinking at that point in time is so clinical like that it had to sort of be that way and that's what's captured within the documents versus.Something more personal I guess"
00:20:03.810 ,Participant 002,"I think so, and maybe this is just my kind of personal opinion, but I think, I prefer, that it's pretty: 'here the stuff is'. Because I mean, not that I think my parents are one of these people, but you know you see all the posts on side of it, you know feel it and how they changed the stories and whatnot and like so to have it just kind of 'Here it is'... I liked it better like that,  which is you know part of why I didn't ask them even after I found the documents I did.",records-content;truth-and-accuracy;adoption-conversations
00:20:40.410 ,Mya,More of just like the the answers that were in there felt like enough.,
00:20:45.570 ,Participant 002,Yeah.,
00:20:53.070 ,Mya,"Well, if there wasn't anything else that particularly stood out to you or that you want to discuss from the the things that you looked at i'd be happy to like transition into your documents",
00:21:05.130 ,Participant 002,"Not that I, not that I don't think that China didn't falsify documents and in some cases of actively preventing people from you know searching or not just not being helpful, but I do think that the situations can't really be equated because of the one child policy. I think that changes things; it goes from you know social stigmas and poverty to here's a government policy telling you: 'get rid of your kid or we'll do it for you' and I think to pretend that that's not a huge impact on what happened...[you'd be] lying.  Like you can't not think about that when you're talking about adoption from China.", government;logistics;adoption-perspective
00:22:08.820 ,Mya,"Does that legal context affect how you feel about being adopted or having been abandoned?",
00:22:25.050 ,Participant 002,"yeah because it makes me... I am not a Korean adoptee, obviously, but I would imagine that I would be a lot more angry at like the country and the culture itself because not all but, like in a lot of cases, you know socio-economic conditions, poverty, but also the huge social stigma against single parents and blood ties in like China had that too, but we also had a government policy.A nd there is where we can... Like I've read Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother by Xinran and I just finished reading a book called Secrets and Siblings by Mari Manninen, and then I read One Child by Mei Fong, all in the past year, all about the one child policy and how it kind of changed how families were made or broken. And while there is, you can't get away without hearing about the cultural stigma against girls, you know a lot of them... It wasn't uncommon or like it was uncommon but not unheard of, you know about selective infanticide even before the one child policy, so you have the social stigma again right that you can be mad at, but then you just have this overarching policy, government-driven policy that impacted pretty much every single person in China and how they lived, how they made family planning decisions or how family planning decisiosn were made for them and you cannot blame the culture on it as much as maybe you could for other countries. And so it gives you a much more of a target to point at of: here's something that was horrible. A little bit of a tangent but in Secrets and Siblings they're interviewing Chinese families and then they asked you know, at the end of each chapter, what do you think of the policy and almost all of them were like supportive of it, and in the book goes into detail about the cultural, historical reasons of why they would be supportive sort of thing and how propaganda con permeated but you read it and it's still a kind of horrifying to me. You're like--what?!",adoption-perspective;government;birth-culture
00:25:08.280 ,Mya,"Does that does that seem to you, then, like the I guess sort of insertion of government policy into culture in a way.",
00:25:27.030 ,Participant 002,"Yeah, I do, because you can't... You read every single of these storiesand you're like, well, they would have made different decisions if... or at least they could have made different decisions if it wasn't for the policy.",government
00:25:47.700 ,Mya,"Do you think that affects your relationship with I guess or even just interest in China writ large versus Chinese culture.",
00:26:05.250 ,Participant 002,"Oh yeah. Obviously, you know that people aren't the government, you can't equate that.But at the same time, you know people should at least be... I mean authoritarian states, but you know, people aren't the goverenment and government isn't the culture, but they are part of the culture. And they're part of the people and so  Chinese culture and stuff can be separated from--parts of it can be separated from the government, but at the same time it's like, well,... You can look at what's happening with you know that the Olympics and human rights violations and you can't just say 'Oh yes, the people are beautiful but it's only the government that's horrible' right? There is a line, but that line is is more of an area. Like I want to visit China again. I wouldn't mind it, I wouldn't mind, you know visiting the orphanage again, doing touristy things, I want to see those karst mountains in Guilin. But to stay and live there on an actual permanent basis is completely unfathomable to me.",birth-culture;adoption-perspective;connection
00:28:34.770 ,Mya,"yDo yo find like with that in mind that you identify more strongly or differently with like diasporic Chinese or diasporic Asian culture in general.",
00:28:55.110 ,Participant 002,"I would definitely identify myself as Chinese Canadian over Chinese every time.I mean if they asked me like ethnicity-wise, obviously I'm chinese. But yeah I would say, I mean I can't even say like I prefer it or anything because I really don't know that much about or haven't tried really to insert myself or learn more about the diaspora. But I don't know, it's complicated.",asian-diaspora;birth-culture;connection
00:29:45.540 ,Mya,"awesome well, so if there's a couple of things, or a thing that you've selected that you wanted to share or talk about...",
00:29:55.560 ,Participant 002,"I meantioned there's a birth certificate, but I think the medical record that I think wasn't a part of the white documents, but I found it as like a spare sheet and I think it's the one they send to the adoptive parents like when they get a referral and go 'here's the child we've matched you to' sort of thing because, like the one in the white documents, it was dated from when I was around five months and I was like interesting and then I found the medical sheet where it has the one examination at five months, but it also has another one that they wrote at 20 days later. And I was thinking, like, that's probably, roughly when I was found. And before that I had no idea how long does I was in the orphanage for  because, like I knew I was adopted when I was under a year old, but I didn't know at all when I entered the orphanage--again because I didn't have an abandonment certificate--so when I found that I was like 'wow, I was there a lot longer than I thought'.",adoption-story;records-content;records-interaction;truth-and-accuracy
00:31:15.090 ,Mya,"Does the fact that you have to do that much sort of sleuthing or like logic-ing frustrate you? Like in addition to your not having an abandonment certificate, that there isn't any type of like paper trail or information that that like you or your parents have about how you got to where you were adopted?",
00:31:50.520 ,Participant 002,"A little. Yeah I mean, it'd be nice to have. You know, to have more than just like a medical exam. Cuz like that means that I was probably found... I would hope that they do their medical exams very soon after, but I don't actually know. Who knows, I could have been in there even more than I thought. But yeah it does frustrate me sometimes.",records-desired;records-content;adoption-story
00:32:25.980 ,Mya,"Does the fact that the only document that you that you really have of that being a medical record is that.Is that emotionally different, I guess, than a certificate.",
00:32:43.410 ,Participant 002,"I think so. Because it wasn't in that white booklet of documents. It was just an extra sheet. I found that by accident, so I do kinda had a more official thing like an abandonment certificate that says,'Here is where we found you are and how old we think you were.'",records-desired;records-content;records-interaction
00:33:14.340 ,Mya,"Was it.I guess exciting as weird verbal but, once you sort of realize that that did have that like additional information was was that.... Did it change like your response to the document? So when you when you first found it, obviously you knew it was a medical record, but then when it turned out that it had that additional information did it change like it's.perceived importance you like that the fact that it wasn't part of the white papers.",
00:33:47.940 ,Participant 002,"To have that be, you know, the first record of my existence is actually it did definitely change it from you know here's the generic medical record to oh, here's the first proof that I was a person.",records-meaning;records-content;records-interaction
00:34:05.880 ,Mya,"I guess thinking about the sort of form and this the formulaic nature of a lot of these documents, like i'm sure you've ended up seeing other people's does it does it feel.impersonal how similar everyone's is or is that I mean obviously that's it's part of bureaucratic documentation that, at the same time would would you wish that it were more personal in any way.",
00:34:39.120 ,Participant 002,"No, because, on one hand, like you said, this is it's a bureaucratic document, an administrative document, it's part of the package you can't be too, you know informal about it there's like you have to follow standards and such. And not necessarily I wish there were documents were more informal, but I wish they maybe had some documents that were more informal about it, because all I have are the formal ones in terms of like Chinese ones.",records-meaning;records-content;records-desired
00:35:12.900 ,Mya,"Do you do you have a sense of like what you would hope those more informal things might say, like obviously this is a very hypothetical exercise but...",
00:35:24.360 ,Participant 002,"Just like 'here's a happy baby. She liked rolling around on the floor. I don't know, babies don't do much. But, you know, I have a cousin with two children now. And everyone when they were little were like, 'We can tell their personality'. Like part of that is probably wishful thinking, but some of it is like you know you *are* developing a personality. And I wish there were something that could indicate that.",records-desired;records-content
00:36:12.660 ,Mya,"did your.did your parents ever create like similar things for sort of you, once you've been adopted or even just sort of tell me stories about this is what you were like you know as early as we, as we knew you.",
00:36:29.790 ,Participant 002,"kinda like like I mentioned that the scrapbook and unless you know mentioned like that I cried a lot. Or like, when I was a kid I liked blowing raspberries, and it was fun. So they do make offhand like comments and stuff like that, but it wasn't necessarily like the scrapbooks weren't meant to be a memoir in that way. It wasn't necessarily mean to give vivid descriptions of what my personality is a child, so it has some, but it was more aboutthe journey as a whole.",adoption-story;records-content
00:37:12.360 ,Mya,"If there were that type of document, would that have similar weight--again thinking of these hypothetical like less formal documents--or the fact that something would be about your time before your adoption, would that give them more importance or just a different sense to them?",
00:37:46.920 ,Participant 002,"Deinitely adifferent sense to them, I don't know about more important necessarily. But also, I guess, not less important. They'd have equal importance, because it would shine light I guess on on a very unknown part of my life.",information-limits;records-use
00:38:07.980 ,Mya,"I'm again thinking about the fact that everything can be so similar to to other people's records, just as a sort of a matter of how documents are created in this context, but also thinking about, I guess, like some of the cultural tropes of like the adoption process. So, someone I was talking to yesterday was talking about like you know the red couch at the hotel type thing those types of tropes of the adoption process and the similarities that...",
00:38:48.030 ,Participant 002,"Yeah, the picture on the staircase.",
00:38:52.020 ,Mya,yeah.,
00:38:52.650 ,Participant 002,"Like there were fancy wooden chairs in the lobby of ours and our adoption group has a picture of us on the chairs and when I went back on my homeland trip, I sat on the chair.",
00:39:05.850 ,Mya,"Do those like build, I guess, a sense of culture is a weird word right because it's a historical thing that you didn't necessarily opt to participate in, but you participated in because you were adopted.Does that feel like the the sort of bringing together, though, have a shared experience that feels like culture that feels like belonging in a way.",
00:39:36.480 ,Participant 002,"I wouldn't go that far. It is definitely... I do consider it a shared experience.",other-adoptees;adoption-story
00:39:42.810 ,Mya,mm hmm.,

00:39:55.770 ,Mya,"yeah are there other other things that you.That you've seen either in like sat or in like other interactions that you've had with adoptees that you would say would evoke that for you.",
00:40:18.420 ,Participant 002,"Kind of? I wouldn't say this is part of culture, but like and again file this under shared experiences, but you know all the different micro aggressions and the difficulty with identity negotiation are shared experiences. But something I actually found through SAAT and the other Facebook groups is like even within adoptees there are so many different opinions and I don't necessarily, I don't know if culture is the right word for it. I mean, maybe between some groups of adoptees, but like all I've seen through some of the groups is that 'Oh, just because we're adopted, we are *not* the same.",other-adoptees
00:41:17.370 ,Mya,"It's sort of an interesting thing right because on the one hand, like people come together in those groups looking for community or for at least like similarities amongst themselves... Is the fact that there isn't necessarilya singular experience that that everyone can identify with... Does that affect like whether or not you view being an adoptee is like a central part of your identity that you can.introduced to be willing, I know you said that you don't necessarily disclose that often that you're an adoptee but does that affect like whether you choose to identify regularly as one?",
00:42:16.620 ,Participant 002,"Not really, because I didn't come to these groups looking for shared experience. I think for some other adoptees I think you know it would have been helpful and I think, maybe I think for some adoptees there they did find a shared culture. It's just that I didn't share the same opinions. It was good for me to join the groups so that I can see the--because it did definitely expand my perspectives on on adoption was meant to be an adoptee searching, and like I would have never have looked up you know historical background if I hadn't jonined these groups. But at the same time you know the opinion that I formed by joining these groups or the ones I haven't changed after joining these groups, I don't necessarily see a lot of people with those opinions.",adoption-centrality;other-adoptees
00:43:29.100 ,Mya,"Was there a particular I guess thing that did make you want to join the groups like you mentioned that you weren't looking for like 'oh i'm looking for people who are exactly like me'. Was there, an impetus, really, or is it more of just kind of 'Oh, this is interesting'.",
00:43:50.430 ,Participant 002,"yeah actually so um I just finished working at the Adoption Agency and I mentioned, I believe in our last call I used to have adoption group reunions with my group. Those actually did stop when I was younger; we didn't really continue them past elementary. But I was at a bus stop in my city and someone called my name and it was one of the girls from my adoption group. And they're like, 'oh let's make a group chat' like 'it's been so long' and it turns out that some of the other families did keep in contact, so the girl who I met was like 'Oh, we should create a group chat, I know the other people.' We don't really talk that much in it, but we had it, and then we had like one Zoom reunion. But anyways they found me and I was like--through talking with them, because our group has kind of active when we first made it, I wondered if there are actual groups for adoptees and that's how I found, I found china's Children International first and then I found SAAT. And I stopped there because, like this is... more than I was expecting.",other-adoptees
00:46:17.610 ,Mya,"I get it, it doesn't need to take up your whole Facebook feed. Do you feel a sense of I guess like camaraderie with your adoption group that extends just beyond 'oh I happen to know them.'",
00:46:39.600 ,Participant 002,"A little. I think it'd be more if I actually knew the well. But I mean I do because, like.I know what one of them was like my cribmates.",other-adoptees;adoption-story
00:46:53.190 ,Mya,"Oh, really.",
00:46:54.810 ,Participant 002,"Yeah. And I know, two of them were also cribmates with each other. And we did have all those you know reunions when we were little. One of the things with SAAT is that that because a lot of people are from all over and mainly the States, it's not that Canadian adoptees are uncommon, but we have to actually specify. Right so yeah I do think, I have a shared camaraderie with them over like other adoptees in SAAT and even ones who I'm kind of friends with just because that we were actually part of the same group, we were definitely from the same orphanage, and someone us slept next to each other as kids. That kind of creates camaraderie, I do think so... I don't necessarily think it's super strong.",other-adtopees
00:47:48.150 ,Mya,"Interesting. The people that I've met or that we would meet up with as an adoption group, I don't think any of them are actually from the same SWI, it was just that we were all adopted at the same time, through the same agency. Which is sort of.... Anyway there any other documents that you were interested in bringing up? It's fine if the answer is no",
00:48:32.520 ,Participant 002,"My birth certificate. First of all, it's what I used to confirm what my Chinese name actually was--the characters. I mean all of [the documents] had it, but it was easiest to tell from the from the birth certificate.",records-content;records-use
00:48:52.380 ,Mya,yeah,
00:48:55.200 ,Participant 002,"Also, you know the whole thing about adoptes and birthdays... I don't even remember when I realized, it could have been that it was an estimate. I don't even think it occurred to me that could have been faked until I joined SAAT.",created-facts;other-adoptees
00:49:11.400 ,Mya,Really yeah.,
00:49:12.660 ,Participant 002,"I don't think it devastated me like some other adoptees kind of felt when they realized it.But it was definitely kind of like, 'Huh, I don't actually know this.' But I mean I kind of mentioned it last one, but like I don't think my orphanage had a history of human trafficking and considering the circumstances of our abandonment, I don't necessarily blame them for it for being off. And also like, what else would I use?",created-facts;information-limits;other-adoptees
00:50:03.510 ,Mya,yeah yeah.,
00:50:05.010 ,Participant 002,"Like like I know people are upset with the uncertainty and I get why, but I'm also like...all of the memories I have of birthday parties and family are all associated with this day. And now that I know I was found when I was relatively young, it's probably not that off... I imagine the older you are the less accurate it is. But I would think for newborns it wouldn't be too off. And then yeah back to like, what? Am I going to say, 'oh, my new birthday is this'?. If I ever for somehow found on my actual one is, I don't think I would change the celebration day. I mean, first of all I wouldn't change any of the documents, I can't imagine the disaster that would be.",created-facts;truth-and-accuracy;records-content
00:51:25.350 ,Mya,My gosh no yeah That would be a lot of work.,
00:51:28.890 ,Participant 002,"Yeah I know some... I've heard through SAAT, I didn't know this was a thing, but some adoptive parents got a second medical opinion then changed their birthdays based on it, but now the paperwork doesn't match. They've said in SAAT their adoptive parents changed their birth date on them. Anyways it's this giant bureaucratic mess now. I would never like try to legally change like birth date and I don't even necessarily think I would change the day I would celebrate it either just 'cause it hasn't been my birthday for the past over 20 years.",created-facts;truth-and-accuracy;records-content;other-adoptees
00:52:35.880 ,Mya,"And what about your name? like I know you mentioned that you have like a particular interest. Was there... I can't remember from our last talk, sorry. Was there ever a moment where you had a similar realization that this wouldn't necessarily have been given to you by your birth parents?",
00:53:00.360 ,Participant 002,"I actually knew that, unlike my birthday, because my parents always told me 'Your last name is from the city.' So because I knew my last name from the city, I kind of knew that it wasn't my birth name. I think I probably had a kind of more serious realization of not only is it not my birth name but it was given to me by like random strangers. But yeah and like it's my middle name right like my parents did keep it my middle name, which i'm glad for. I am glad they didn't make it my first name because it's like... First of all, the whole teasing thing, but also like I can't pronounce it right, and there is no no way anyone would ever pronounce it right either. I've had a Chinese person tell me when I told them what it was, they were like 'Are you sure?.",names;created-facts;other-people
00:54:13.710 ,Mya,Really? Interesting.,
00:54:15.840 ,Participant 002,"Because it's not common. I told someone the characters once and they're like are you sure, and I was like yes. So it's not a common name. Maybe if I went to China and needed to use a Chinese name, I'd use it, but I'm not considering going by it like socially and I'm definitely not considering legally, changing it.",names
00:55:00.090 ,Mya,"If you were to finally or like not so finally but suddenly.figure out 'Oh, this was this was supposed to be my name', Do you think you would have an attachment to that name, even though it's something you'd never encountered before or would it be another one of those things where it's kind of, 'even if it's true about me, it's not necessarily the thing that i've associated myself with this entire time' and therefore...",
00:55:39.450 ,Participant 002,"Yeah like I think it'd be... It would be meaningful to me to know you know my birth parents actually named me, but like I just said, I think there'd be a connection to it, but I wouldn't consider making it like my primary name and I also I don't even-- I think it'd be meaningful but also probably be a step below my orphanage name. Just kind of like that's the one I have known longer.",names
00:56:17.190 ,Mya,"If bureaucracy weren't such a hurdle to go through and you had that informaiotn, would you still sort of just hold it within like your brain and yourself and not necessarily want to add it to your documents or to any type of like record of of you.",
00:56:51.720 ,Participant 002,"yeah I don't... I mean part of it is, I mean you mentioned bureaucracy being must faster, but I don't know--I already have a first name middle name last name I don't necessarily think I want to add more names to it. I know people with like for middle names and I'm like 'why?'. So yeah it would be one of those things of I would keep it to myself, but it would mean something to me.",records-creation;records-
00:57:25.770 ,Mya,"Do you remember what it was like going through sort of your box or your like folders the first time, when you decided like 'okay i'd like to look at my records'.",
00:57:41.760 ,Participant 002,"I mean kind of it's a mix of just like 'Oh, that's interesting'...Like 'Oh OK, so I did spell my name right, or this is how they spelled things' And then kind of a bit of 'What are these?' once I got past the big ones. It's not just all my Chinese documents in one folder, it's like other stuff from Canada too. And I was like, 'oh, didn't know I had this'. I don't even think I found the the medical record ...or I did notice that the first date, that it said five months, but then I don't think I even *really* noticed. It wasn't necessarily like a momentous occasion, but it was a thing.",records-interaction;records-meaning;records-awareness
00:59:09.390 ,Mya,"Has it felt similarly or has that sort of 'non momentous but a thing' emotion, or like response to looking at them sort of lessened the more that you've looked at them.",
00:59:24.690 ,Participant 002,"yeah because, like when I look at them now, I know what to them.",records-interaction
00:59:32.670 ,Mya,"Do not knowing that information and having that information, would you say that the actual documents.mean Less more just the same.",
00:59:49.440 ,Participant 002,"A bit more, because I didn't know what they were before  I looked at them, or I didn't know what exactly there were but I wouldn't say they mean less now, but I know about it just because like sure I remember now, but like these are pieces of evidence of that information.",records-meaning;records-interaction
01:00:14.730 ,Mya,"Given I guess sort of your experience and like knowledge of the I guess the process of documentation, but also just what documentation there isn't as out there are there are there things that you wish, or that you would hope that adoptees would like know or understand about like their records of the process of either like accessing or finding or.being denied their records.",
01:00:55.980 ,Participant 002,"Yeah so I mean I sent this to you months ago after your first post, but like I did make a document about you know finding or potentially like ways you could try to get your records back. My impression is that but a lot of the folks in SAAT don't seem to realize their Chinese name and characters are in it. or like it doesn't occur to them, maybe cause a lack knowledge of how Chinese like the language works as well as how people are named... But I don't think a lot of them realize-- because they aske, they go my name was this and then they're like what does that mean? And it's like well, we don't know we can guess, but like Chinese has like 1000 homophones, so good luck, but the characters are there in your documents. And then I don't think a lot of people know what their adoption documents even are. It's like kind of... Asking for your documents is not hard or no that's not true, depending on your situation can be hard, but it's not selfish. You should know what these are these, these are yours they're your records of existence, and my impression is that in the American system they actually do have a legal use -- whereas like like I said in Canada, because I have my citizenship, I haven't needed them for anything -- but my impression is that you guys have to have your birth certificate, citizenship, and every single record for everything. You should know of [these documents's] existence, you should also be able to look at them. Depending on how old you are, I get your parents not wanting to just like hand them to you permanently right, But I don't get the parents who are like 'you're not allowed to look at them. That's crazy to me like. They're our birth certificates, you know? I would not blame them for not wanting to look at the home study, that is the exception to that. Because it is part of the adoption documents, but at the same time that one's not about us. So that is one exception, I would not blame them for not wanting the home study or that part of the records I don't think, but I any one that's specifically about us, I don't understand not wanting them to look at them. And then I guess part of it is also 'do you understand how hard it would be to replace these, guys?'. I mean just their existence, knowing their importance and then knowing, you know, you can find some really interesting information in there, if you just look.", records-interaction;records-ownership;records-awareness;records-access;records-content
01:04:22.260 ,Mya,"What drew you to want to create that? Was it just a matter of seeing the same questions like over and over again?",
01:04:31.770 ,Participant 002,"Yeah and then I mean, it wasn't even that often--maybe five times or something. And they're all for various reasons, not all of them were like 'my adoptive parents wouldn't let me see them'. Some of them were like they got stolen, they got lost. And then I was like, 'wait what happens if mine get lost?' Like I said 'I should know how to replace these, right?' Because you can just google where to get a replacement birth certificate or like 'Oh, I need to my passport was stolen.' But any non-Canadian legal document, I don't know what I do. Honestly, if you read that document, the answer is I don't know still. Because their places you can get file copies of them, but to get them reissued? You're not getting them reissues, so good luck. So keep copies. So yeah, I saw a couple posts and, like the first step is always contact your adoption agency, but then there's like nothing afterwards, and I was like not only do I think this is actually useful for people in this group, but this is also going to be very useful to me. Hopefully I will never have to use it, but I should know it.", post-adoption-services;records-awareness;records-access
01:06:01.200 ,Mya,"Thinking about copies are sort of preemptive measures for ensuring that that you have the I guess intellectual information of the documents, would you say that if, for whatever reason, the originals became damaged or stolen or you for whatever reason you weren't able to have access to them, does that change the value of a copy so like right now, if you have a copy doesn't have an emotional significance to it, or even like a legal significance to it. Does it only become valuable if they're the originals were to ever become loss.",
01:06:51.780 ,Participant 002,"I mean they have value in that they're still... like they're not the original, but they still have the information. I mean yes, they become more valuable it for whatever reason my original gone, but I don't necessarily think... Like, it's just kind of practical.",records-meaning;records-use;records-access
01:07:13.290 ,Mya,Yes.,
01:07:17.010 ,Participant 002,"I mean I guess less than the originals, but like yeah it still contains that the same information too",
01:07:31.230 ,Mya,"Would you--again hypothetical, I'm not about to like come to your House and steal your documents--but would you feel sad if the originals were to somehow no longer be something you could access.",
01:07:50.310 ,Participant 002,"Yeah depending on if I have copies of them that makes me more even. But yeah because, again, I can get my passport back, I can get my citizenship, thought that one would take me a while. I could get my record of landing, that would also take me a while, but I can get it back.If I didn't have... I would still have their copies and while it wouldn't necessarily be an issue legally because, again in Canada, I don't to have anything, but that would make me really sad... I don't necessarily think I'd go through the whole pain of trying to get them reissued, but I think I would go through the trials of trying to get copies back.",records-meaning;records-access;post-adoption-services
01:08:50.970 ,Mya,"Would you generally say that you that you feel like you have a I guess an emotional attachment like, especially since they're not.Legally, significant for you, would you say that their sort of existence is more or like your attached to them is mostly just sort of emotional.",
01:09:15.810 ,Participant 002,"Yeah. I mean some of them like, I mean, obviously, like the ones with my birthday, right? There's my legal part. I mean it's not my only proof of my person, but it gave the information i needed, like my Chinese name is my middle name kind of thing . But yeah they are, they are mainly emotional.",records-meaning;records-content.
01:09:39.600 ,Mya,Is it odd to think about the fact that you have like an emotional connection to paper?,

01:10:12.660 ,Mya,Have you ever looked over any of your paperwork with your parents or has it always been like a solitary activity.,
01:10:30.270 ,Participant 002,"Just me. When I was younger we went through the like the scrapbook together,but I couldn't read, I just looked at the photos. No, I haven't and it hasn't ever occurred to me to want to do that.",adoption-conversations;records-interaction
01:10:53.910 ,Mya,"yeah do you do you remember, in terms of like when you were going through those packets was there, additional like information or context that that you've I mean obviously you mentioned, you couldn't read so wouldn't necessarily know at the time but looking back at it, was there sort of like additional like anecdotes or things that came up like through the process of going through those albums with them versus like when you look at it, or when you looked at it by yourself.",
01:11:23.280 ,Participant 002,"I mean, probably don't remember. Every so often sometimes,cuz I mean not as much anymore kind of moved away, but we used have dinner together. All of our meals were kind of free for all, but yeah we always had dinner together unless someone was going out or anything. But sometimes when wer were at the table, topics about our childhood would come up and about how we acted and I'm like, 'that's new information'.But.yeah I mean they probably told anecdotes on top of what was actually written scrapbook I have no idea what they were.",adoption-story;records-content
01:12:02.460 ,Mya,"Is that like additional information or those types of things that have come up within like conversations or something is that something that you that you wish were documented in some way or that you've tried tried to document like yourself.",
01:12:21.630 ,Participant 002,"I haven't tried to. Yes, it'd be nice, but I also understand why they wouldn't document every moment of our childhood.",adoption-story;records-content
01:12:37.170 ,Mya,"Skipping backwards, thinking about like sort of what you what you said that you wish other adoptees would know about, like their documents, you also mentioned that you don't think your siblings have necessarily interacted with theirs. Is that something that you feel like you could have a conversation with them about or that you would want to or not so much.",
01:13:11.520 ,Participant 002,"I would be willing to have the conversation, I don't know if I would ever initiate it. I did this alone, and I wanted to do it alone ... I mean, we don't have really a precedent you don't actually talk to this about each other. They also didn't know I was doing this and I didn't tell them either. So I don't think I'd have that conversation unless something else initiated it first.", other-adoptees;records-awareness;adoption-conversatiosn
01:13:55.470 ,Mya,Do you.have strong feelings about their potentially seeing your documents?,
01:14:08.460 ,Participant 002,"Not really. I mean they're bureaucratic. Like we've looked at each other's photo albums because my parents meant for us to look at them. I haven't looked at them for a while, but like we have. But those were also created with people looking at them in mind. And again all these documents are like through bureaucratic ones and also, I was under a year old. What am I gonna be embarrassed about? What's the secret? They know my birthday, they know my name. They know my Chinese name--actually I don't even know if they know what their chinese names are, but we all knew at one point, I just don't think they care that much. Not that I know what they're thinking, nut I am kind of under the impression that, of the three of us, I'm the most interested in the documentation and that sort of thing.",records-ownership;records-interaction;adoption-conversations;adoption-story;records-creation
01:16:32.970 ,Mya,You mentioned that I guess sort of each of your siblings and yourself having like your own album like.did your parents ever create or sort of express like a I guess like a holistic family narrative in relation to like all of your adoptions.,
01:16:55.500 ,Participant 002,"I mean holistic and that they all look the same, But I mean no, and I don't necessarily think I felt I ever felt like they needed to... We have separatealbums because first of all we were adopted three years apart. And, second of all they were very different adoption journeys each each time, not just because of the kids but like because of all the circumstances, how they traveled and whatnot and then also because you know they got got more experienced at it as time went on.",adoption-story;family-ties
01:17:46.560 ,Mya,Are there um.I guess other records like created by your family in relation to your adoption that you.Like a. obviously know about but b. think are like particularly Valuable or important to how you have like seen or sort of understand like your adoption story.,
01:18:20.370 ,Participant 002,"I mean I mentioned like we have the book the scrapbooks and for the homeland trip. But not necessarily that they created, but stuff they brought back. We have a bunch of souvenirs that they got like on our homeland trips but also things they brought back when we were adopted. I can't remember what it was, but I know, like my aunts and uncles they all have like some sort of souvenir that my parents brought back when we were all adopted.",adoption-story;records-creation;birth-culture
01:18:51.390 ,Mya,Oh interesting.,
01:18:53.880 ,Participant 002,"Right, because you know they're in China too, might as well buy souvenirs. I can't remember what it was, but we saw it on like my aunt's shelf or something and we asked, 'Oh did they bring that back?' and my aunt was like, 'oh yeah they brought that back when you were adopted' that sort of offhand, 'yeah that was from when you were adopted', and I think... I don't know, it's not the most important thing, because not even mine, it doesn't relaly have a relationship to me, but it's another thing of like 'here was something we took back from this time'. And like somewhere we have our ink chops. We did this whole like cleaning of the house during the pandemic last year, and so everything kind of moved around. So I asked my mom about it, and she said it's definitely somewhere, we did not throw it out. And then I forgot about it because, well, what would I use it for? But maybe I will ask her about it. Someone posted about theirs on CCI and said that whoever did theirs got the name wrong. Because they were probably just told 'oh her name is this, get that on a stamp, but they didn't tell them what the characters were'. So they were probably like, 'these are common ones for that name, that's probably that it is, right?' Wrong! so I was like, I wonder if mine is right because by that time I had already kind of looked into names and was like, if people don't know the characters, it's not gonna be right.",birth-culture;records-creation;records-interaction
01:21:39.000,Mya,"Would that have been made when you were adopted? Your chop?",
01:21:47.100 ,Participant 002,"Yeah. We have something else that was like it was a touristy thing, I went on my homeland trips before I cared much about adoption, and so it's like Chinese characters that spell [my name], so it's not actually my Chinese name, it's my English name pronounced ina Chinese way. I have stuff like that yeah. I don't actually think at that time I knew what the characters were; on my trip, when I was under time. But yeah the chop would have been from when I was adopted.",
01:22:30.750 ,Mya,"I you mentioned like 'What are you going to use it for?' but does that does that still sort of have like a significancy like especially like the idea that it could be something that you use like I guess it like sign things.",
01:22:50.970 ,Participant 002,"I mean it has my Chinese name so I couldn't use it for anything. But it does have... I mean, it's another thing of 'here's something from before I was adopted' It would be important to me because it's another thing from before. I think I would be more or less connected to it once find out if it has my name right. But it is something I mean I could... the only thing I would use it for would be for a decorative like Christmas card that I send solely to my immediate family who actually know what my Chinese name is.",
01:23:54.210 ,Participant 002,"Okay, this is kind of a tangent, but during the pandemic at like the very start of it, because we couldn't get together, we we did like family trivia over Zoom and whoever won got to make the questions for the next one and I won one and that was when I was learning Mandarin, so I had like a section on book, one on musical instruments, and then I had one on Mandarin but it was really easy stuff and it was all multiple choice. And for most of them, I was like here's the character for mountain and then does it mean mountain does it mean grass does it mean river.Like that. And then my bonus question was that I put my Chinese name and asked, like, what do you think this means? No one got it, but then one of my parents did because I think I gave them the clue that 'mom or dad should actually know this, it's on a painting in your room.' But yeah, so  I do think it's another symbol of  me having a life before I was adopted.",names
01:25:26.550 ,Mya,"You mentioned it being on a painting in their room. Does that mean that you signed a painting with your Chinese name or that they had a painting commissioned?",
01:25:35.040 ,Participant 002,"Oh no, it was from the culture class. We were told to paint and then we would put our Chinese name on it, they told us what the characters were and we drew it. Actually don't think I actually don't remember if I wrote it right, but anyway it's like a seven year old's messy painting.",names;records-creation
01:26:07.770 ,Mya,"Is it.Is it nice I guess that they still have it up like after all this time, like that specifically.Something like that versus you know any other art that.",
01:26:24.660 ,Participant 002,"They have a lot of our art. Well before we did the whole spring cleaning and they took a lot of it down and asked 'do you want this?' Which is understandable. But I don't think it meant more I don't think it and not even now I don't necessarily means more to me than the other painting to put up of my childhood art",names;records-creation
01:26:52.560 ,Mya,"Would you say that you've always have I guess the same relationship with your name or has it changed like more now that you that you know more about Chinese names.",
01:27:07.980 ,Participant 002,"it's mostly been the same I mean. I think it's strengthened the connection to it, definitely, now that I once I learned more, but again I wouldn't I would never go buy it unless I was in like China, or something and.yeah I will have no intention of changing my name from what it is now yeah.",names
